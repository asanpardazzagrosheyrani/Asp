# Interoperability with Wallet Connect

**![image](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IhEDi3rBFiwfO2BwZ2Q-L7vQpXP1RTEO0Vd0inRcit2ljJOLkYwSE5gt4OVLUI5bklh4QPc8dJY-cNGF0KBhSDXKnMZIxFnMDws-0UgJ2ibXAWAIrvNx5ldtgqg7HcDdd2tDt0DY4NnusL7gPYmfFL1OLLMsFymkjSg9fh5auAMnhVl_YolUBz6z)**

Now that we have connected the Torus Wallet plugin to our DApp, you should be able to view the logged in wallet on Torus by clicking on the icon on bottom-left and then choose the option _Open Wallet_. The user can now access their _private key_ from the Torus Wallet interface and can proceed to connect with _Wallet Connect_ using the _Get Started with Wallet Connect_ option on the Torus Wallet App.

## Summary

In this rollercoaster of a tutorial we learned how to ship an End to End application.

- We started off by creating our own smart contract using solidity and the Remix IDE.
- We then did some backend exploring with web3auth and also learned how to use the Torus Wallet and Wallet Connect.
- After that we set up a pretty detailed react project which helped us to integrate everything and play around with our DApp!

We encourage you to run this DApp on your local server and play around with it much more. Try to see different functionalities and understand the codebase better on your own.

Armed with this knowledge you should be ready to go out and create any dApp of your choosing with a fully functional frontend!

And of course, if you liked the tutorial, show it some love on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vbVMUwXWgc).

See you in the next one!
