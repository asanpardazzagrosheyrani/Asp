## üö¥üèª A quick tour about Web3Auth

In order to use this new world Twitter app (Web3 Twitter), we need to make it a service that recognises unique users and their identities. Conventionally, this is done by creating or associating user accounts in the app. We‚Äôll take a safer approach and associate user accounts instead of creating and managing them in-app. ü§î

Ever heard of SSO (Single Sign-On) ? SSO makes the user experience much safer and more reliable. Since, in this tutorial, we‚Äôre cloning an MVP of Twitter in Web3, we‚Äôll be using Twitter social login (Login/Sign Up via Twitter) to log the user into the app.

In this section, we‚Äôll explore the Web3Auth library and look at how its underlying functionalities can help us create a secure SSO connection with Twitter. Web3Auth offers a secure full suite of libraries to integrate social logins across all the major third party platforms, in addition to, integration with your own custom authentication and wallet connectivity. Considering it is purpose built for authentication infrastructure of dApps and wallets, it reduces the onboarding time to seconds and goes a step further to offer non-custodial multi-factor authentication, removal of seed phrases (users losing access to their keys is no more a hassle) and integration support with third party APIs (such as FIAT to Crypto conversion). ü§©

First let‚Äôs create a Torus Wallet which will be useful to integrate with the web3auth library

#### **Creating Torus wallet**

Your Torus wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a Torus account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.

One cool thing about Torus wallet, compared to MetaMask, Trust Wallet and other popular options is its Social Login Sign On. This allows you to simply Sign In via a Social Profile without worrying about managing your private keys and/or remembering your Seed Phrases. In case the keys are required, they are viewable on the Torus Wallet and are interoperable with most other wallet providers.

So, let‚Äôs go!

Here are the installation steps:

-   Go to [app.tor.us](https://app.tor.us/)
-   Sign Up via your preferred Social Login such as Twitter, Google, etc

-   And, you are done! Quite easy, right?

Congrats! your account is created and you must have received a public address. The public address will be on the top-right of the Torus Wallet Home in the pattern of:

_Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_

![TorusPubAddress](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IQTqTguac36emOR0m3m9VeKgLikUWDlKsSI4UdCNGgAECVkIBAmOq86kICsIHl3c3Wjcz7nYzYkc7VBTF9mqxT5NtAsX6ORQsB510Qsv7vqQIGLz-vFRwieNruVJ5eOQWOwo1_QtXPqYj0o9OflRJAJ0TvC6QO3ufwgnt4GVyM_3CGve6SvTX5xY)

You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store Ethereum based tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?

Yes, it is completely safe to share your public address! You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store Ethereum based crypto.

#### **Changing your network on Torus**

We will not be using the live/production environment at the moment because it will be expensive to deploy a contract. You will need some real MATIC to do that! And of course, learning and deploying contracts on production for the purpose of learning is not sustainable.

![MaticNetworkChange](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/acBAfkKzFqKa5AIaOG3_lqY5cPMKG8JLo6NEK656R3o7HGJZyNu8Fd517DnQRHvC5n44Amz38bV104S539ew9_0IsZndAI2Q911v5Q7Jp752mn1oLSjv3g6igsnRQXccnuVqacHkmrkGrXfMkKLUH0D3FrMeY-AZZroh1-oz7R9SfMZlG77lvcda)

We will switch to Matic Mumbai (Polygon Testnet) Network, which is a test network that pretty much is a simulation of Polygon blockchain production. Just navigate to the Settings page of Torus Wallet and switch your network to Mumbai. Just like in the above image.

#### **Get your private Torus Wallet key**

Private keys can be accessed from the Settings page in the menu of Torus Wallet:

**Important note:**  Never ever share your private keys with anyone. It is the master access to your wallet

Keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export the private key and paste it somewhere secure.

üö® DON‚ÄôT COMMIT YOUR PRIVATE KEY ON GITHUB, DON‚ÄôT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON‚ÄôT SHARE IT ANYWHERE!

üö® IF YOUR PRIVATE KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

üö®BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!
