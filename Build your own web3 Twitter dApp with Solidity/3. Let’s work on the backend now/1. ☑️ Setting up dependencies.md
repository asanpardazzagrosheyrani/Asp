# Let’s work on the backend now

## ☑️ Setting up dependencies

Enough of Remix already, it is time to open everyone’s favorite way to code - VS Code!!

Now before we move on to the frontend let’s download our boilerplate or clone the boilerplate of twitter dApp. [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/twitter-dapp-boilerplate)

Once you have the boilerplate, open the folder in VS code.

Now go to your package.json file and populate that file with the following code

```perl
{
    "name": "twitter-dapp",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "private": true,
    "dependencies": {
        "@alch/alchemy-web3": "^1.4.6",
        "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
        "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
        "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
        "@types/jest": "^27.5.2",
        "@types/node": "^16.11.60",
        "@types/react": "^18.0.21",
        "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.6",
        "@web3auth/base": "^2.1.2",
        "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter": "^2.1.2",
        "@web3auth/torus-wallet-connector-plugin": "^2.1.2",
        "@web3auth/web3auth": "^2.1.2",
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        "react-bootstrap": "^2.5.0",
        "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
        "react-icons": "^4.4.0",
        "react-app-rewired": "5.0.1",
        "react-toastify": "^9.0.8",
        "typescript": "^4.8.3",
        "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "start": "react-app-rewired start",
        "build": "react-app-rewired build",
        "test": "react-app-rewired test",
        "eject": "react-app-rewired eject"
    },
    "eslintConfig": {
        "extends": [
            "react-app",
            "react-app/jest"
        ]
    },
    "browserslist": {
        "production": [
            ">0.2%",
            "not dead",
            "not op_mini all"
        ],
        "development": [
            "last 1 chrome version",
            "last 1 firefox version",
            "last 1 safari version"
        ]
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "assert": "^2.0.0",
        "buffer": "^6.0.3",
        "crypto-browserify": "^3.12.0",
        "https-browserify": "^1.0.0",
        "os-browserify": "^0.3.0",
        "process": "^0.11.10",
        "react-app-rewired": "^2.2.1",
        "stream-browserify": "^3.0.0",
        "stream-http": "^3.2.0",
        "url": "^0.11.0"
    }
}
```

And then go to your terminal and run

```cmake
npm install
```

Great, now in the root directory create a file called  **config-overrides.js**  and paste the following code in this file

```php
const webpack = require('webpack'); 

module.exports = function override(config) {

  const fallback = config.resolve.fallback || {};

  Object.assign(fallback, {

    crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),

    stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),

    assert: require.resolve("assert"),

    http: require.resolve("stream-http"),

    https: require.resolve("https-browserify"),

    os: require.resolve("os-browserify"),

    url: require.resolve("url"),

  });

  config.resolve.fallback = fallback;

  config.plugins = (config.plugins || []).concat([

    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({

      process: "process/browser",

      Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],

    }),

  ]);

  config.ignoreWarnings = [/Failed to parse source map/];

  return config;

};
```

Now have a peek inside the src/ folder , you should see a lot of files inside it already.

We need 2 important files

1.  **App.css**
2.  **App.tsx (We will come to this later)**  
    

**App.css**

This is a simple CSS styling file, this styling isn’t relevant to this tutorial, so we are not going to go into detail.

Just remove everything in this file and copy-paste all of the code which we have already made for you!

You can find the link to the App.css here

[https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Twitter-Dapp/blob/main/src/App.css](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Twitter-Dapp/blob/main/src/App.css)

Before moving on, we now need to discuss the concepts that are involved in integrating with the Web3Auth Libraries and the Torus Wallet.

Note: The next section is just to introduce you to the concepts involved using some basic code snippets, you don’t need to add any of this code to your projects until we reach the “Getting back to the Twitter DApp” section.
