# How to deploy your smart contract

This is where the real power of the Remix IDE will shine. Creating & deploying simple independent smart contracts is super simple with Remix!

## Let’s now try to deploy our newly constructed smart contract on the Polygon Mumbai Network

Before we start, make sure you have MetaMask installed on your browser. If you don’t know how to do this you can refer to our tutorial [here](https://metaschool.so/course/understand-and-setup-metamask-account)

Once you have got all this setup we are ready to deploy our contract

Go to the compile tab of the Remix IDE and click on “Compile TwitterDapp.sol”

When the contract compiles, go to the deploy tab right below the compile tab, and change environment to “Injected Provider - Metamask”

After you do this the MetaMask window will pop up now you have to do 3 things:

1.  Make sure you are connected to Remix
2.  Make sure you are on the Polygon Testnet Network
3.  Make sure you have some Testnet, MATIC, if you don’t have any MATIC you can get it from a [faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)

Once you are ready just choose the TwitterDapp contract in your contract tab, and click on **Deploy**

Confirm the MetaMask transaction and wait for 10-15 seconds and you should see your contract deployed on the left bar.

**Note**: Make sure to copy your contract address from the bottom and store it somewhere. Also better not to close your Remix browser yet :)

We will be needing all of this soon when we create the frontend!

And with that we have successfully deployed a smart contract on the Polygon Mumbai Blockchain!

**Congratulations!!**

**Maybe, let's go back to our** [**Quicknode**](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) **dashboard and check if our node is working or not?**

**Go to your Quicknode dashboard and click on metrics and check if you have any activity**

Now let’s create a matching frontend for this application!
