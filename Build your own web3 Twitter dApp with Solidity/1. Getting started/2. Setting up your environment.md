# Setting up Quick Node

Ethereum is a distributed network of computers, every time we write, update or transact on the Ethereum blockchain, these computers need to register our transaction and agree on it. Either we can write a program to do this on our own (it can be time and engineering intensive) or we can use a service that makes it super easy and simple for us to achieve it.

[Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) is a powerful blockchain development suite offering API and node services both of which allow for seamlessly interacting with blockchains (Polygon Mumbai blockchain in our case). Today, we will particularly be using the [Quicknode’s](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) node service for our transactions on blockchain.

For now let’s go ahead and set up a node for ourselves. So go and quickly set up your own free [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) account and come back.

Let’s sign up at [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner), get your free account, and follow the instructions below.

Sign up for your free account and get to create an endpoint.

1.  Chain - Polygon
2.  Network - Polygon Mumbai

Your WSS key and HTTP address is important, save it somewhere for now, and now let’s setup your [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) with your metamask

Go to your Metamask Wallet and add new network

1.  Network Name - Polygon Mumbai
2.  New RPC URL - Your [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) HTTP provider
3.  Chain ID - 80001
4.  Currency Symbol - MATIC
5.  Blockchain Explorer - [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)

## Let's get some fake MATIC $$

Try the following websites and try to get some fake MATICs. This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. This is not real money, you can’t buy NFTs, or other assets via these MATIC.

All you have to do is to drop your public address on the following links and the MATIC will be transferred.

1.  [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
2.  [https://mumbaifaucet.com/](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)

Huff, that was a lot of setup! But doing this in the very beginning of the course will be very convenient when we get our hands dirty with the code.

So what are we waiting for? Let's get to it!
