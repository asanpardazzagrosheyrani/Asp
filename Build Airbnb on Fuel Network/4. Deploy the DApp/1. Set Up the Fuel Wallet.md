# Set Up the Fuel Wallet

Awesome work till now. Now we are one step closer to deploying our dApp. Let’s quickly set up our wallet too!

Open a new terminal in your `airbnb-contract` directory and complete the following steps:

1. Initialize a new wallet: 
    
    ```
    forc wallet new
    ```
    
    - You will be prompted to enter a password. Set the password for this and confirm it.
    - After setting the password, you will see the mnemonic phrase in the output. Save it somewhere safe. DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE! These phrases are private information that can be used to hack your account. We will also need it to import our wallet so make sure to save it.
    - Hit the Enter/return button.
    
2. Create a new account:
    
    ```
    forc wallet account new
    ```
    
    - You will be prompted to enter the password you set in the previous step. Enter it and press the Enter/return button. Make sure to save your Wallet mnemonic phrase
    - You will get your fuel address. Save it as you'll need it to sign transactions to deploy the contract.

- Now finally set a password for your wallet, make sure its a strong password or else you won’t be allowed to move forward and please make a note of your password because trust me you need this whenever you are going to sign a transaction.

- And we are all set, let now move on to top it up with some faucet ETH because we will be needing this to pay for the gas.

**Note:** Your wallet might not show the same wallet address as shown on your terminal. So, remember to use the wallet address as shown on the terminal to get some fake tokens.

## Get some tokens

Now it’s time to get some fake money in your wallet. Follow the steps given below to get some tokens:

1. Head over to [https://faucet-beta-4.fuel.network/](https://faucet-beta-4.fuel.network/).
2. Paste your wallet address. 
3. Submit the CAPTCHA.
4. Click on “Give me Ether” button.
5. You will receive 0.5 ETH in your wallet.

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned how to set up our wallet, create a new account, and obtain our fuel address. We also learned how to get tokens from a faucet. Now we can proceed with deploying our contract. Let's move on to the next step!
