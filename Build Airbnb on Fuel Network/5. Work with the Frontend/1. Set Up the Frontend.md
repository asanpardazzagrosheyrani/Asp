# Set Up the Frontend

Kudos! We have deployed our dApp and we are all set to proceed in setting up our frontend. No more waiting, let’s go!

## Setting up the Airbnb frontend

Open a new terminal in your `airbnb-contract` directory or continue using the previous terminal if opened. 

Run the following command to clone the frontend directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/fuel-airbnb-frontend-boilerplate.git
```

Let’s install our dependencies:

```
npm install
npm install fuels@0.60.0 @fuel-wallet/sdk@0.13.0 --save
```

Time to move our ABI JSON files to the front end.

1. Copy your `airbnb-contract` path and replace [PETITION_PATH] with it.
2. Copy your `frontend` path and replace [FRONTEND_PATH] with it.

```
npx fuels typegen -i [AIRBNB_CONTRACT_PATH]/out/debug/*-abi.json -o [FRONTEND_PATH]/src/contracts
```

This will add the `contracts` folder to your `src`:

Now run the following command to start your app:

```
npm start
```

You will see an output like this:

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, we learned how to set up the front end for our dApp. We cloned the frontend directory, installed dependencies, and moved the ABI JSON files. Congratulations on completing this lesson and setting up your dApp's front end! Happy coding!

In the next lesson, we will interact with our dApp.
