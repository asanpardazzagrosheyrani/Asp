# Write Your Token Smart Contract

Welcome to the new lesson folks! Great work on connecting your MetaMask to Sepolia network. In this lesson, we will write code for our token. So, Let’s dive into it.

## Start by going to Remix IDE

- Go to [http://remix.ethereum.org/](http://remix.ethereum.org/) or open Remix desktop app anything you prefer.
- Click on “create file” at the top of your file explorer panel and create `MyToken.sol`.
- Now click on `MyToken.sol` and let’s add some code.

So, your `MyToken` will contain the code and the OpenZeppelin library will be used to write our smart contract. As you can see, we wrote only 5-6 lines below this cat GIF to make our token!

## Final code

The final code will look like this.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
	constructor () ERC20("Mango Coin", "Mango") {
		_mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
	}
}
```

You can copy this code and change `Mango Coin` and `Mango` with the name of your token and symbol.

Go ahead, try it out! After you’re done with it, move to the next lesson.
