# Write your token smart contract

Welcome to the next lesson. It's smart contract time!

## Start by going to Remix IDE 🔥

- Go to [http://remix.ethereum.org/](http://remix.ethereum.org/) or open Remix desktop app anything you prefer
- **Click on create file** at the top of your file explorer panel and **create MyToken.sol**
- Now **click on MyToken.sol** and let’s add some code

So, your MyToken will contain the code and the OpenZeppelin library will be used to write our smart contract. As you can see, we wrote only 5-6 lines below this cat GIF to make our token!

The final code will look like this 👇🏼

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor () ERC20("Mango Coin", "Mango") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

You can copy this code and change 🥭Mango Coin and Mango with the name of your token and symbol.

Go ahead, try it out!
