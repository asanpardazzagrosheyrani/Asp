# Deploy your token

After we are done with our coding part, letâ€™s proceed to deployment where we will be launching our token on Ethereum testnet.

Just some clicks left before launching your token and barely 5 more mins to go!

I can't wait ðŸ˜±

To start the deployment, go to the Solidity Compiler section on your left sidebar and then **click Compile MyToken.sol**

- After the compilation, **click on Deploy** right under Solidity Compiler on the sidebar and **select Injected Provider** as Environment
- A popup will appear to connect your MetaMask wallet so just select the account in which you received your free ETH from the faucet

- **Click on Deploy** to launch your token. Do not change any value other than environment
- A MetaMask popup will appear to sign the transaction. Confirm it and you will have successfully launched your own token on Ethereum Network ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Letâ€™s check if our token is deployed correctly.

- Scroll down and copy your contract address under deployed contract in Remix by **clicking the copy icon**

- Go toÂ [](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)Â [https://goerli.etherscan.io/](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)Â and search for your contract address

Wooohoooo our token has been created.

Now letâ€™s add our token to our MetaMask and check if we received our minted 1000000 Mango Coin. To do this, you'll have to:

- Go to your MetaMask, go to asset and **click on import token**

- Paste your contract address and rest of the details will be auto filled. Then **click on add custom token** and import the token
- Now you will see your 1000000 tokens minted to your Ethereum Goerli address ðŸ˜Ž

### Here is a quick video walkthrough:

## Summary

The code we wrote is basic and is not ready to be deployed on the mainnet as we are still missing the SafeMath function and we donâ€™t have any utility for the token as of now.

Next up we'll advance more and write our ERC20 token from scratch and implement SafeMath, certain tokenomics related functions like Mint, Burn, Buy and Sell Tax. But for now let's finish this!
