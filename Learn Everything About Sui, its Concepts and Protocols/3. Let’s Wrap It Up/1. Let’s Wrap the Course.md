# Let’s Wrap Up the Course

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! 🎉 It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. I am super excited for all of you since you all have decided to start with Sui and here we are completing our very first course together.

## Understanding of Sui blockchain

You gained a basic knowledge of the Sui blockchain. You understood what consensus mechanism it uses, what problems Sui solves, and the history of Sui in detail. Let us recall what we learned about Sui.

Sui is a permissionless Layer-1 blockchain. Unlike existing Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, Sui offers lightning-fast transactions with predictable fees and complete ownership of one’s dynamic digital assets.

## Dope stuff on Sui

You explored what developers are building on Sui blockchain, what applications are already built on Sui, and what you can also build. You explored how Sui developers can be supported by grants by delving into the world of Sui blockchain.

## Understanding of Sui Architecture

You gained in-depth knowledge of how Sui works, what consensus it uses and what are the fundamental properties of Sui.
