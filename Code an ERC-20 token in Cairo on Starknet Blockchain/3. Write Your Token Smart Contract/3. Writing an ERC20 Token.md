# Writing an ERC20 Token

Welcome back! So you have set up your development environment. Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to learn how to write ERC20 token, maybe waitâ€¦letâ€™s call our token PEPE Token! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## What is an ERC20 token

ERC20 tokens are fungible tokens and are replaceable by another token of the same type, just like money. For example, a $10 bill in one wallet holds the same value and can be exchanged for another $10 bill. 

## Methods in ERC20

So ERC20 token has many important methods. Going through them is important as it will help us in writing our contract. So letâ€™s see the methods and what do they return:

- `name() -> (name: string)` : returns tokenâ€™s name
- `symbol() -> (symbol: string)` : returns the symbol of token
- `decimals() -> (decimals: uint8)` : returns the decimals of token
- `totalSupply() -> (totalSupply: uint256)` : returns the total supply of token
- `balanceOf(account: address) -> (balance: uint256)` : queries and returns the balance of a specific account
- `allowance(owner: address, spender: address) -> (remaining: uint256)` : queries and returns the allowance assigned to a spender by an owner
- `transfer(recipient: address, amount: uint256) -> (success: bool)` : transfers a certain amount of tokens from a sender to the specified recipient
- `transferFrom(sender: address, recipient: address, amount: uint256) -> (success: bool)`  : allows a spender to transfer a certain amount of tokens allowed to be spent by the owner/sender to the specified recipient
- `approve(spender: address, amount: uint256) -> (success: bool)` : approves a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens from the ownerâ€™s wallet

## Create a file

Letâ€™s create a file named `erc20.cairo`in `src`:

## Essential imports

We will add the following imports:

```
%lang starknet

from starkware.cairo.common.cairo_builtins import HashBuiltin

from starkware.cairo.common.uint256 import Uint256

from starkware.cairo.common.bool import TRUE

from openzeppelin.token.erc20.library import ERC20
```

## Constructor

Weâ€™re going to start with initializing the constructor of the contract. For this we will first write `@constructor` and then our code:

```
@constructor

func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

   _name: felt, _symbol: felt, _decimals: felt, initialSupply: Uint256, recipient: felt

){

   ERC20.initializer(_name, _symbol, _decimals);

   ERC20._mint(recipient, initialSupply);

   return ();

}
```

## Types of functions in Cairo

So, we have two types of functions in Cairo: external and view. We will add `@external` decorator for external functions and `@view` for view functions. So you might be wondering, whatâ€™s the difference in both! Let me tell you. View functions are read calls or getter functions. They donâ€™t modify the storage of contracts. For example, theÂ `name`Â function will return us the name of our token. While external functions can also modify the state of blockchain. For example, `transfer` function allows the sender to the specified recipient.

## Implementing other functions

So now letâ€™s start implementing the functions and ERC20 token contract.

### Name

It is a view function that returns the name of token upon querying. Yes, you might have guessed it right, we are not changing blockchainâ€™s state so we used a `view` function.

In the following function, we call theÂ **`name`**Â method in Openzeppelinâ€™s contract using theÂ **ERC20**Â namespace and then return the result we get. Re-using the code and saving our effort ðŸ˜Ž!

```
@view

func name{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (name: felt) {

   let (name) = ERC20.name();

   return (name,);

}
```

### Symbol

It is a view function. It returns the tokenâ€™s symbol upon querying.

```
@view

func symbol{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (symbol: felt) {

   let (symbol) = ERC20.symbol();

   return (symbol,);

}
```

### Decimals

It is a view function. It returns the tokenâ€™s decimals upon querying.

```
@view

func decimals{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (decimals: felt) {

   let (decimals) = ERC20.decimals();

   return (decimals,);

}
```

### Total supply

It is a view function. It returns the total supply of token.

```
@view

func totalSupply{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (totalSupply: Uint256) {

   let (totalSupply) = ERC20.total_supply();

   return (totalSupply,);

}
```

### BalanceOf

It is a view function. It returns the total amount owned by a particular account upon querying. Similar to the other functions in this contract that we discussed above, this function also utilizes Openzeppelin's internal `balance_of` function. 

But thereâ€™s a little bit of difference i.e., we have an argument too!!! The argument `[account]` is the account number of the wallet whose balance we want to know.

```
@view

func balanceOf{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(account: felt) -> (balance: Uint256) {

   let (balance) = ERC20.balance_of(account);

   return (balance,);

}
```

### Allowance

It is a view function. It queries and returns the amount of tokens assigned to a spender by an owner.

```
@view

func allowance{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(owner: felt, spender: felt) -> (remaining: Uint256) {

   let (allowance) = ERC20.allowance(owner, spender);

   return (allowance,);

}
```

### Transfer

It is an external function. Finally the first external function!! So it initiates a transfer from the sender to the specified recipient. We are changing the state of blockchain.

```
@external

func transfer{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

   recipient: felt, amount: Uint256

) -> (success: felt) {

   ERC20.transfer(recipient, amount);

   return (TRUE,);

}
```

### TransferFrom

Another external function it is! This function enables a spender to transfer a specific amount of tokens that are authorized by the owner/sender to the designated recipient. For example, now I can send say $10 to Alice using my account to hers.

```
@external

func transferFrom{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

   sender: felt, recipient: felt, amount: Uint256

) -> (success: felt) {

   ERC20.transfer_from(sender, recipient, amount);

   return (TRUE,);

}
```

### Approve

Last external function it is! So, it approves a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens from the wallet of owner.  

```
@external

func approve{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

   spender: felt, amount: Uint256

) -> (success: felt) {

   ERC20.approve(spender, amount);

   return (TRUE,);

}
```

   return (allowance,);

}
@external

   return (TRUE,);

}
@external

) -> (success: felt) {

   ERC20.transfer_from(sender, recipient, amount);

   return (TRUE,);

}
@external

func approve{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

   spender: felt, amount: Uint256

) -> (success: felt) {

   ERC20.approve(spender, amount);

   return (TRUE,);

}
```

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we completed writing ERC20 token in Cairo programming language.

In the next lesson, we will deploy it on the Starknet blockchain.
