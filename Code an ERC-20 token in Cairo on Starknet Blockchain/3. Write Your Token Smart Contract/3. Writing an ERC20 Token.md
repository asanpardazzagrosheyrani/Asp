# Writing an ERC20 Token

Welcome back! So you have set up your development environment. Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to learn how to write ERC20 token, maybe waitâ€¦letâ€™s call our token PEPE Token! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## What is an ERC20 token

ERC20 tokens are fungible tokens and are replaceable by another token of the same type, just like money. For example, a $10 bill in one wallet holds the same value and can be exchanged for another $10 bill. 

## Methods in ERC20

So ERC20 token has many important methods. Going through them is important as it will help us in writing our contract. So letâ€™s see the methods and what do they return:

- `name() -> (name: string)` : returns tokenâ€™s name
- `symbol() -> (symbol: string)` : returns the symbol of token
- `decimals() -> (decimals: uint8)` : returns the decimals of token
- `totalSupply() -> (totalSupply: uint256)` : returns the total supply of token
- `balanceOf(account: address) -> (balance: uint256)` : queries and returns the balance of a specific account
- `allowance(owner: address, spender: address) -> (remaining: uint256)` : queries and returns the allowance assigned to a spender by an owner
- `transfer(recipient: address, amount: uint256) -> (success: bool)` : transfers a certain amount of tokens from a sender to the specified recipient
- `transferFrom(sender: address, recipient: address, amount: uint256) -> (success: bool)`  : allows a spender to transfer a certain amount of tokens allowed to be spent by the owner/sender to the specified recipient
- `approve(spender: address, amount: uint256) -> (success: bool)` : approves a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens from the ownerâ€™s wallet

## Create a file

Letâ€™s create a file named `erc20.cairo`in `src`:

## Essential imports

We will add the following imports:

```
%lang starknet
// Import the HashBuiltin function from the cairo_builtins module.
// HashBuiltin is a function provided by Cairo that allows you to hash data.
from starkware.cairo.common.cairo_builtins import HashBuiltin

// Import the Uint256 class from the uint256 module.
// Uint256 is a class provided by Cairo that represents unsigned 
// 256-bit integers.
from starkware.cairo.common.uint256 import Uint256

// Import the TRUE constant from the bool module.
from starkware.cairo.common.bool import TRUE

// Import the ERC20 class from the library module of the erc20 package
// in the openzeppelin.token module
from cairo_contracts.src.openzeppelin.token.erc20.library import ERC20
```

## Constructor

Weâ€™re going to start with initializing the constructor of the contract. For this we will first write `@constructor` and then our code:

```
// The @constructor tag indicates that this is the constructor function 
// for the contract.
@constructor

// func keyword is used to define a function in Cairo
// constructor is the name of the function, which is a reserved keyword in 
// Cairo that denotes the constructor function.
func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

Â Â Â _name: felt, _symbol: felt, _decimals: felt, initialSupply: Uint256, recipient: felt

){

Â Â Â ERC20.initializer(_name, _symbol, _decimals);

Â Â Â ERC20._mint(recipient, initialSupply);

Â Â Â return ();

}
```

## Types of functions in Cairo

So, we have two types of functions in Cairo: external and view. We will add `@external` decorator for external functions and `@view` for view functions. So you might be wondering, whatâ€™s the difference in both! Let me tell you. View functions are read calls or getter functions. They donâ€™t modify the storage of contracts. For example, theÂ `name`Â function will return us the name of our token. While external functions can also modify the state of blockchain. For example, `transfer` function allows the sender to the specified recipient.

## Implementing other functions

So now letâ€™s start implementing the functions and ERC20 token contract.

### Name

It is a view function that returns the name of token upon querying. Yes, you might have guessed it right, we are not changing blockchainâ€™s state so we used a `view` function.

In the following function, we call theÂ **`name`**Â method in Openzeppelinâ€™s contract using theÂ **ERC20**Â namespace and then return the result we get. Re-using the code and saving our effort ðŸ˜Ž!

```
// Indicates that this is a view function
@view
// Defines a function called "name" that takes in 3 arguments
func name{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (name: felt) {
// Calls the "name()" function on an ERC20 token and stores the result 
// in a new variable called "name".
Â Â Â let (name) = ERC20.name();
// Returns a tuple containing one element (the value of the "name" variable).
Â Â Â return (name,);

}
```

### Symbol

It is a view function. It returns the tokenâ€™s symbol upon querying.

```

// Define a function called "symbol" which takes three pointers as arguments and // returns a tuple with one element.

// The pointers are of type "felt", "HashBuiltin", and an unspecified type
// (which will be inferred by the compiler).

@view

// Call a function "symbol" from a library called ERC20, 
// which returns the symbol of an ERC20 token.

func symbol{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (symbol: felt) {

Â Â Â let (symbol) = ERC20.symbol();
// Return a tuple with one element, which is the symbol of the ERC20 token.
Â Â Â return (symbol,);

}
```

### Decimals

It is a view function. It returns the tokenâ€™s decimals upon querying.

```
// Define a function called "decimals" which takes three pointers as arguments 
// and returns a tuple with one element.
// The pointers are of type "felt", "HashBuiltin", and an unspecified type 
// (which will be inferred by the compiler).
@view

func decimals{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (decimals: felt) {
// Call a function "decimals" from a library called ERC20, 
// which returns the number of decimals used by an ERC20 token.
Â Â Â let (decimals) = ERC20.decimals();

// Return a tuple with one element, which is the number of decimals 
// used by the ERC20 token.
Â Â Â return (decimals,);
}
```

### Total supply

It is a view function. It returns the total supply of token.

```
// Define a function called "totalSupply" which takes three pointers 
// as arguments and returns a tuple with one element.
// The pointers are of type "felt", "HashBuiltin", and an unspecified type 
// (which will be inferred by the compiler).
@view

func totalSupply{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (totalSupply: Uint256) {
// Call a function "total_supply" from a library called ERC20, 
// which returns the total supply of an ERC20 token.
Â Â Â let (totalSupply) = ERC20.total_supply();

// Return a tuple with one element, which is the total supply 
// of the ERC20 token.
Â Â Â return (totalSupply,);

}
```

### BalanceOf

It is a view function. It returns the total amount owned by a particular account upon querying. Similar to the other functions in this contract that we discussed above, this function also utilizes Openzeppelin's internal `balance_of` function. 

But thereâ€™s a little bit of difference i.e., we have an argument too!!! The argument `[account]` is the account number of the wallet whose balance we want to know.

```
@view
// Define a function called "balanceOf" which takes four pointers as 
// arguments and returns a tuple with one element.
// The first three pointers are of type "felt", "HashBuiltin", and an 
// unspecified type (which will be inferred by the compiler).
// The fourth argument is an integer value (of type "felt") called "account".

func balanceOf{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(account: felt) -> (balance: Uint256) {
// Call a function "balance_of" from a library called ERC20, which returns 
// the balance of a specific account for an ERC20 token.
Â Â Â let (balance) = ERC20.balance_of(account);
// Return a tuple with one element, which is the balance of the account for the // ERC20 token.
Â Â Â return (balance,);

}
```

### Allowance

It is a view function. It queries and returns the amount of tokens assigned to a spender by an owner.

```
@view
// Define a function called "allowance" which takes four pointers as arguments 
// and returns a tuple with one element.
// The first three pointers are of type "felt", "HashBuiltin", and an 
// unspecified type (which will be inferred by the compiler).
// The fourth and fifth arguments are integer values (of type "felt") called 
// "owner" and "spender", respectively.

func allowance{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(owner: felt, spender: felt) -> (remaining: Uint256) {
// Call a function "allowance" from a library called ERC20, which returns 
// the remaining allowance of a spender for a specific owner.
Â Â Â let (allowance) = ERC20.allowance(owner, spender);

// Return a tuple with one element, which is the remaining allowance of 
// the spender for the owner.
Â Â Â return (allowance,);

}
```

### Transfer

It is an external function. Finally the first external function!! So it initiates a transfer from the sender to the specified recipient. We are changing the state of blockchain.

```
@external
// Define a function called "transfer" which takes four pointers as arguments 
// and returns a tuple with one element.
// The first three pointers are of type "felt", "HashBuiltin", and 
// an unspecified type (which will be inferred by the compiler).
// The fourth and fifth arguments are integer values (of type "felt") called 
// "recipient" and "amount", respectively.
func transfer{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

Â Â Â recipient: felt, amount: Uint256

) -> (success: felt) {
// Call a function "transfer" from a library called ERC20, which transfers 
// a specific amount of ERC20 tokens to a recipient.
Â Â Â ERC20.transfer(recipient, amount);
// Return a tuple with one element, which is a Boolean value indicating 
// whether the transfer was successful.
Â Â Â return (TRUE,);

}
```

### TransferFrom

Another external function it is! This function enables a spender to transfer a specific amount of tokens that are authorized by the owner/sender to the designated recipient. For example, now I can send say $10 to Alice using my account to hers.

```
@external
// Define a function called "transferFrom" which takes four pointers 
// as arguments and returns a tuple with one element.
// The first three pointers are of type "felt", "HashBuiltin", and 
// an unspecified type (which will be inferred by the compiler).
// The fourth, fifth, and sixth arguments are integer values (of type "felt") 
// called "sender", "recipient", and "amount", respectively.

func transferFrom{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(

Â Â Â sender: felt, recipient: felt, amount: Uint256

) -> (success: felt) {
// Call a function "transfer_from" from a library called ERC20, which transfers // a specific amount of ERC20 tokens from the sender to the recipient.
Â Â Â ERC20.transfer_from(sender, recipient, amount);
// Return a tuple with one element, which is a Boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful.
Â Â Â return (TRUE,);

}
```

### Approve

Last external function it is! So, it approves a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens from the wallet of owner.  

```

@external
// Function name and input parameters.
func approve{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
// Represents the address of the spender to approve the token transfer.
// Represents the amount of tokens to approve for transfer.
Â Â Â spender: felt, amount: Uint256

// Specifies the return type of the function, boolean value indicating success.
) -> (success: felt) {

// Calls the approve function from the ERC20 contract, 
// allowing the spender to transfer the specified amount of tokens.

Â Â Â ERC20.approve(spender, amount);
// Returns a boolean value indicating success, with the value of "TRUE".
Â Â Â return (TRUE,);

}
```
