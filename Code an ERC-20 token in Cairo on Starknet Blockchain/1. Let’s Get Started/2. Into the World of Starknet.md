# Into the World of Starknet

So hey folks, we just understood what is required to start this course. If you are here, it means you have a knack to learn something new. That new is yes, Starknet blockchain!

## What the heck is Starknet?

So, what even is Starknet and why should you know about it?

Starknet is an open-source platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a high-performance and secure environment for developers to build their dApps. 

While it may sound and look like a cross in between Star Trek and the NASA logo, Starknet is a really cool open-source scaling solution to build dApps which retain Ethereum’s security but not its gas fees. To break it down we can say Starknet equals to:

1. High throughput
2. Low gas fees
3. Ethereum’s security

## Unveiling Starknet’s arsenal

Whatever was stated above clearly didn’t get into the entirety of how Starknet really works. It’s got plenty of features up its sleeve, so let’s scroll down a bit and get into them one by one.

To begin with, Starknet is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Why the need to scale, though? Tbh, Ethereum is congested. Everyone and anyone is on that chain, and we hate to break it you, being there costs plenty of gas fees.

But Layer-2s like Starknet = High throughput + Ethereum level security + low gas

When talking about security, Starknet is secured by zk-SNARK. What do we mean by this? In easy words, this feature allows someone to prove the truth of something without giving away their secret information, and they can do it without needing to talk back and forth with another person.

Starknet is also developer-friendly, with a comprehensive SDK and developer tools. This makes the lives of developers easy in building and deploying dApps on the platform.

See, that wasn’t so difficult, right? Onto the Cairo, we go!

## Introduction to Cairo Programming Language

So till now we learned a lot of cools stuffs about Starknet but hey? that’s not all!

Well Starknet also presents a rust inspired language called Cairo, which basically help you to build on Starknet exactly like Solidity for Ethereum.

You know the best part is if you are familiar with Smart contract and Rust, you are half way, let us help you capture the other half!

## Wrap up

In conclusion, we have learned about the exciting world of Starknet and Cairo. We explored some of the key features of Starknet, including its layer 2 scaling, flexibility, and high performance. We also discussed Cairo, a high-level programming language designed for building complex and secure smart contracts. 

In the next lesson, we will set up the environment for writing our own contract. Don't forget to complete the assignment on staking in Starknet before moving on!
