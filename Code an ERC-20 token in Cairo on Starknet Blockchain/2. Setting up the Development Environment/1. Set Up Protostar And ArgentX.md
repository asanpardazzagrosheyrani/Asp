# Set Up Protostar And ArgentX

Welcome back!  So we completed leaning about Starknet and Cairo programming language. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to learn how to set up the dev environment for running our code. We will set up Protostar and ArgentX now! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## What is development environment?

We now need a super cool environment to run our code in and we need to set it up!

For this tutorial, we will use Protostar, ArgentX wallet, and then StarkScan for navigating the network. Don‚Äôt worry, setting them is super easy and you will do it no time!

## What is protostar?

It‚Äôs a development framework for building and deploying smart contracts on the Starknet network.

If you are a **Windows users**,  install WSL before proceeding. Just open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in¬†administrator¬†mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator", enter the `wsl --install` command, then restart your machine. You can refer [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more info.

Here are steps on how to install Protostar:

### Steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to install Protostar.
2. Run the following command:

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/protostar/master/install.sh | bash -s -- -v 0.10.0
```

3. Restart your terminal.
4. Run the command, `protostar -v` and you will see results similar to what‚Äôs shown below:

## Download boilerplate code

To give you a quick head-start, we have this boilerplate code. [Download it from here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/erc20-starknet-cairo-boilerplate) and make your journey easier and swift.  

![Screen Shot 2023-06-08 at 3.58.04 PM.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/raw/main/Code%20an%20ERC-20%20token%20in%20Cairo%20on%20Starknet%20Blockchain/2.%20Setting%20up%20the%20Development%20Environment/Set%20Up%20Protostar%20And%20ArgentX%20ef2934af5df64d39871f246bcba637d1/Screen_Shot_2023-06-08_at_3.58.04_PM.png)

We have following folders:

- The `src` folder contains your contract's source code
- The `test` folder contains your test files.
- The `openzeppelin` folder contains the Openzeppelin library files.

We also have an important file, `protostar.toml` that holds your command configurations, allowing you to avoid passing arguments each time you run a command.

Now let‚Äôs move on to ArgentX setup‚Ä¶

## Setup ArgentX

It is one of most popular wallet and only-freely available wallet on Starknet.

You can add it easily using browser extension. For chrome, just go to [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/argent-x/dlcobpjiigpikoobohmabehhmhfoodbb/related) link and then add to chrome.

Once you add ArgentX extension to Chrome, you will be redirected to new page. Click on create a new wallet, accept terms and conditions and then add your password. Your wallet will be created, easy-peasy, isn‚Äôt it üï∂Ô∏è

Now, your ArgentX will look something similar to what‚Äôs shown below.

## Getting some tokens

Now, it's time to get some test tokens, so we can deploy our contracts on Starknet.

Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

- Open your Argent X wallet.
- Change the network to Testnet, it‚Äôs usually located in the top right corner. It will ask you to create an account for testnet. so upon creation, your network will be set to Testnet.

![create testnet account.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/raw/main/Code%20an%20ERC-20%20token%20in%20Cairo%20on%20Starknet%20Blockchain/2.%20Setting%20up%20the%20Development%20Environment/Set%20Up%20Protostar%20And%20ArgentX%20ef2934af5df64d39871f246bcba637d1/create_testnet_account.gif)

- Now, you need to copy your account address from your wallet. It's like copying your home address to receive something.

- Go to [https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/](https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/) using your web browser. This is a special website that helps you get some test tokens for your Testnet account. Connect your wallet and hit the Send Request button.

![Screen Recording (1).gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/raw/main/Code%20an%20ERC-20%20token%20in%20Cairo%20on%20Starknet%20Blockchain/2.%20Setting%20up%20the%20Development%20Environment/Set%20Up%20Protostar%20And%20ArgentX%20ef2934af5df64d39871f246bcba637d1/Screen_Recording_(1).gif)

- Now, all you have to do is wait for the transaction to complete. Check your wallet after around 5 mins, you will see at least 0.002 amount credited to your wallet.

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned about setting up a development environment for running our code. We used Protostar along with Argent X for wallet interactions and a faucet to get some tokens.

In the next lesson, we will finally start writing the code of ERC20 token.
