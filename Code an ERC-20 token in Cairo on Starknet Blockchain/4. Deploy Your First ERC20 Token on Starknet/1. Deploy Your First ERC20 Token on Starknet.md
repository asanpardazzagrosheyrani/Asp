# Deploy Your First ERC20 Token on Starknet

Welcome back! So we have completed writing our ERC20 token. You did great! In this lesson, we will dive into deploying your token to Starknet blockchain by running commands in the terminal. Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Updating files


### Update `protostar.toml`

First we will add our file `erc20.cairo` in the `protostar.toml` , so we can build our contract. Update the file as follows:

```
[project]
protostar-version = "0.13.0"

[contracts]
erc20 = ["src"]
```

This file holds all your command configurations. Under `[project]` we define the version of protostar. To let protostar know where our contracts are, we define the contracts path under `[contracts]`. We can also give them a nice name accordingly.


### Update `contract.cairo`

Replace the existing content with the following:

```
mod erc20;
```

### Update `lib.cairo`

Replace the existing content with the following:

```
mod contract;
```

## Build your contract

Open the terminal and run the following command to build your contract:

```
protostar build
```

The output of this command will be similar to what is shown below:

After this you will be able to see that a new folder named build is also created and it has the json file and other files of your contract.

## Get your private key

Now we need to export private key of your account. Enter your password of the wallet and then copy your private key.

Now run the following command after replacing **[ARGENTX PRIVATE KEY HERE]** with your private key:

```
export PROTOSTAR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=[ARGENTX PRIVATE KEY HERE]
```

- **Warning: Do not share your private key with anyone! Itâ€™s superrr private!!!**
    
    

Now open your wallet, copy your account address and save it! This is our ArgentX account address. We are going to need it for our next steps.

## Declare your contract

Run the following command after replacing [ARGENTX ACCOUNT ADDRESS] with your ArgentX account address. Kindly note that the `erc20` is the filename, so if your filename is something else, make sure to replace it.

```
protostar declare erc20 --network testnet --account-address [ARGENTX ACCOUNT ADDRESS] --max-fee auto
```

In case you encounter an error like following, it means that similar code has been declared before. It will not be allowed to be declared again as Cairo generates same class hash for same code. You can use a unique token name and symbol in the constructor to make your code different. If you do not want to declare your unique contract; you can just skip this step and move to deploying your contract.

> Wait for a minute or two after declaring your contract. Otherwise it will show an error if you try to deploy it right away.

## Deploying your ERC20 token

Get your class hash first, you can find it in `build` folder. Copy it.

Now run the following command to deploy after replacing: 

- **[CLASS HASH]** with the class hash that you copied.
- **[ARGENTX ACCOUNT ADDRESS]** with your ArgentX account address.

```
protostar deploy [CLASS HASH] --network testnet --account [ARGENTX ACCOUNT ADDRESS] --max-fee auto
```

Your contract is deployed!!! You can go to the StarkScan transaction hash link and see an overview.

Click on **Deployed Contracts**. Go to **Read/Write Contract** to interact with your deployed contract.

In the **Read** part, you can check the name, symbol, balance, etc of your account.

To interact with the **Write** part of your contract, click on Write and connect your wallet.

After connecting, you can call any function. We have shown the interaction using `mint`:

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we deployed an ERC20 token on the Starknet blockchain by running commands on the terminal. Now no-one can stop you to writing and deploying contracts on Starknet. Good luck with your future deployments!
