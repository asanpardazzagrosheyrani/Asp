# What the Hell Is the DN404?

We’re so proud of you for covering all about the ERC404 token standard. Now, we will explore the shortcomings of ERC404 and get to know about the DN404 in detail.

## ERC404 hype

You must have heard of the statement that with great responsibility comes a great price. This is what happened with the ERC404. ERC404 hype caused the high gas fees among the Ethereum  ecosystem which made it even more difficult for developers like you and us to create the custom ERC20 tokens.

This is where the DN404 came into the picture. Out of frustration and to resolve the gas fees issue, a group of developers introduced “Divisible NFT-404” token (DN404).

DN404 is built upon the established and up to date ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. It introduce the better approach to manage the user balance and NFTs seperately. This setup promises a smoother experience for users and more efficient handling of tokens.

## That’s a wrap

In this course, we will use the DN404 to implement the token and create a marketplace for it. So, stay tuned and start building! 

In the next lesson, we will setup the development environment and install important dependencies.
