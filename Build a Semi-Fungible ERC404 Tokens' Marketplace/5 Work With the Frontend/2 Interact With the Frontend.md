# Interact With  the Frontend

Great work on setting up the frontend for the marketplace project. Let’s interact with it now.

## Interact with the frontend

Let’s explore our marketplace features one by one.

1. First of all, connect your MetaMask wallet using the “connect wallet” button.
2. Go to the “List NFT” field, enter your NFT contract address, and click on the “List NFT with Permit” button, to list your NFT on the marketplace.
3. If you want to delete the listing, go to the “Cancel Listing” field and click on the “Cancel Listing” button.
4. If you want to buy an NFT share, go to the “Buy NFT” field, enter the NFT details and the amount of share you want to buy, and then click on the “Buy NFT” button.
5. At last, if you want to update the price of your token share, go to the “Update Listing Price” field.
