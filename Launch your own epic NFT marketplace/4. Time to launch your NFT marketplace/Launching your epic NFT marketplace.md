Try clicking random mint buttons and see what happens.

Play around with it, it is yours now!

Take care of two things though:

1. That you have enough MATIC in your metamask wallet to buy the NFTs.
2. You can’t mint more than 2 NFT, because we have set a minting limit of one per address. So you can try minting NFTs from other accounts if you want more than 2, or you can re-deploy your smart contract with the new minting limit!

## Viewing your NFTs in metamask & polygonscan

You can now go to the polygonscan of your smart contract and see the various details of how the mint took place.

You can also check if the NFT has been airdropped to your account or not:

1. Go to [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) and check the contract address to see the latest transactions.
2. Go to [https://testnets.opensea.io/](https://testnets.opensea.io/) and search your contract address to see minted NFTs.
