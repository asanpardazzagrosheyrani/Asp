# Let‚Äôs Wrap It Up

## üéäCONGRATULATIONS!

Congratulations on completing this cool course and taking your AI development skills to the next level.

We just wrapped up a lit course on how to use OpenAI to make a bot that can translate the code to any other programming language. Now, it's time to take a moment and go over all the cool stuff we learned in this course.

## You revised the AI and OpenAI concepts

At the start of this course, we revised the AI and OpenAI concepts and learned how AI is revolutionizing this modern world. We revised the different GPT models and learned how to access OpenAI API. 

## You learned how to write text generation code in NodeJS

Before starting the code translator, you first learned to install the NodeJS in your system. You learned how you can setup the NodeJS app and write the code that uses OpenAI API and generates text. You learned how to train the model using prompts.

## You learned how to set up the development environment

At the start of the code translator, you learned how to use the GitHub desktop and clone your app. You learned to install the dependencies and ran your first NextJS program.

## You learned to build an AI bot

After setting up the basic NextJS application, we dived straight into creating the front-end of our application. You learned to create the code editor that allows to copy the code, language selector scroll down bar, and code window where you can write and edit the code. Then you learned to create a languages array containing all of the languages you wanted to populate the dropdown with. Lastly, for front-end, you learned to create a home page in NextJS.

After creating the front-end, you learned prompt engineering. You learned how you can train the model and write the back-end for your application.

Lastly, you learned how you can run your application and experiment with it.

## Daily life use

You can use this AI bot in your daily life.

1. You want to learn a new programming language? Head over to code translator and ask to generate the code or convert the code using the programming language you already know.
2. You already have written a piece of code in one language but finding it hard to write the same logic again in another language? Head over to code translator and convert your code in an instant.

## ‚öíÔ∏è A small yet important request:

This is a 100% open-source project like all the other projects on our platform. You can find the tutorial markdown files [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/tree/main/Code%20Translator%20-%20Translate%20Your%20Code%20to%20Any%20Other%20). If you find any issues in the course, please feel free to resolve it. We, at Metaschool, love love love contributions by our community and acknowledge the contributors on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vbVMUwXWgc) and GitHub, too.

While you‚Äôre contributing:

1. Don‚Äôt forget to star ‚≠êÔ∏è our repository. We will be very thankful! ‚ù§Ô∏è
2. We are a completely free platform and we aim to stay the same, so please consider following us on [X](https://bit.ly/code-trans-twitter) and [LinkedIn](https://bit.ly/code-trans-linkedin) as well. ü´∂


## Stay Connected

Don't forget to flex your new AI bot on Twitter and tag us @0xmetaschool. Stay connected with us and keep leveling up. Remember, OpenAI is a game-changer that can transform the world as we know it. So keep pushing boundaries, keep expanding your knowledge, and let's change the game together.

We appreciate you taking this journey with us and hope to see you again in our future courses. Keep hustlin'!

WAGMI! Peace out! ‚úåüèªüîÆ
