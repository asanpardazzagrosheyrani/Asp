# What’s Up?

Hi fam, Welcome to Metaschool. Today we are here with another exciting course!

We're talking about a course where we're going to teach you how to make your very own AI bot using the latest and greatest technology - the GPT-3.5 model. And not just any bot, we're talking about a bot that’s going to auto translate your code to any programming language of your choice! Not just this, you can give a description of the code you want to generate, in Urdu or English, and it will generate the code for you in any programming language you choose.

Now, I know you're probably thinking, "Hey, why would I want to make a bot that translates the code?" Well, let me tell you, my friend, as a developer having your own personal code translator will help you learn various programming languages and generate code in any programming language using natural language (e.g., English, Spanish, Hindi you name it). Not only this, it will help you convert your code to any other language just in an instant.

Let me give you a sneak peek of the one and only Code Translator that you're ever going to want to build!

But don't take my word for it, you gotta try it out for yourself. We've got a live code translator on [this website](https://main--mellow-granita-e0a938.netlify.app/), that's already causing a stir. People can't get enough of it! So, before you even start this course, go check it out and see what all the fuss is about.

So, are you ready to step up and take on the challenge? Let's do this! 

## **Prerequisites**

Learning new tech is always easier when you have some prior knowledge. So, before diving into OpenAI and AI model development, we recommend brushing up on the following:

1. Programming knowledge: You’ll need basic programming knowledge to start experimenting with advanced languages. Knowledge of Javascript programming language is a plus.
2. Critical thinking: To wrap your head around the complex and abstract concepts in OpenAI and AI, you'll need some solid critical thinking skills.

But don't sweat it, – you can still learn OpenAI API and AI model development without knowing everything in advance. It's just gonna be way smoother if you got some background knowledge under your belt. 

## **Learning outcomes**

1. What is AI, OpenAI, and GPT models
2. How to set up the development environment with OpenAI, NodeJS, and NextJS
3. How to write text completion models in NodeJS
4. How to use the amazing openAI GPT-3.5 model
5. How to build a responsive front-end app in NextJS
6. How to write a back-end that uses OpenAI API and interacts with front-end
7. How to improve accuracy of responses through machine learning-based training using prompts
8. How to run the NextJS app that uses OpenAI API
