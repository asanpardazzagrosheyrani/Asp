# What are we building today?

gm everyone üåà, I am¬†Munim¬†and along with Aswin and Fareeha, we are very excited to bring this AI based learning tutorial for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? Today we're going to build our very own AI bot using the latest and greatest technology - the GPT-3.5 model. It's going to auto translate your code to any programming language of your choice! Not just this, you can give a description of the code you want to generate, in Urdu or English, and it will generate the code for you in any programming language you choose.

This project is important, because it will give you basic understanding of how to build AI based project using the latest APIs of OpenAI. Cool, right?!

ChatGPT is the buzz word around these days and OpenAI owns it. OpenAI has the total funding	of USD 1 Billion (4 Rounds) with monthly mctive users (MAU)	of 21.1M+. It offers various APIs and we can make use of them to build awesome and cool applications. Code translator is one the examples. Let me give you a sneak peek of this:

So, are you ready to step up and take on the challenge? Let's do this!

## Course overview

We will:

1. Cover some super cool basic understanding of AI, OpenAI, and GPT models
2. We will set up the development environment with OpenAI, NodeJS, and NextJS
3. We will write text completion models in NodeJS using amazing openAI GPT-3.5 model
4. We will build a responsive front-end app in NextJS and back-end that uses OpenAI API and interacts with front-end, then we will run it

## Proof of completion
