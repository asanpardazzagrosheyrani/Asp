# Building the YeBot!

Now, let’s dive into the dope world of the YeAI Bot Project. This project is all about creating a Kanye West AI bot that can chat with you and answer your questions in Kanye West style. It's gonna be a blast!

### Key Features of YeBot

Check out some of the key features of the YeAI Bot Project:

- Understanding natural language input so you can talk to it like a real person.
- Improving accuracy of responses through machine learning-based training using prompts.
- Use of the amazing openAI GPT-4 model to generate responses that sound real.
- Personalizing responses based on your interactions and data, so it feels like you're chatting with a real Kanye West.
- Integrate the model with NextJS and run the server using Flask.

## Let's Get It Started: Code & Prompts

We’ll be using code and prompts to build our YeBot. As we have learned in previous lessons that how effective the prompts are, we will use them to train our model and build the dope shit!

To train our model, we'll use MindsDB Cloud and the OpenAI engine. By setting up our development environment and using an OpenAI API key we have already generated.

**Don’t Worry**! We will explain everything one-by-one. So, let’s buckle up to learn and build!

## Setup your development environment

First things first! Let’s setup our development environment and learn what the hell is MindsDB.

## What is MindsDB?

Now, if you ain't heard of MindsDB, let me put you on. It's an open-source tool that makes it easy for anyone to create and train machine learning models. You can use it to build all sorts of AI bots, from chatbots to recommendation systems.

## Why MindsDB for YeAI development, you ask?

- MindsDB is perfect for Kanye AI bot development 'cause' we can code in MindsDB and it's super easy to use, even if you're not a data scientist or a machine learning whiz.
- We can use as many models as we can in MindsDB. You want to use GPT-3? You want to use GPT-4? You got all of this!
- In MindsDB, we have full control, we can use as many features as we can.
- There’s no limit in MindsDB, you can use it for as long as you want to use it.
- Above all, we can easily train our model using prompts!

## Setting up the Development Environment on MindsDB Cloud

Here's how to set up the development environment on MindsDB Cloud:

- **Step 1:** Sign up for an account on [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/login?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=twitter-chatbot-tutorial-2023-03).
- **Step 2:** Go to [https://cloud.mindsdb.com/editor](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/editor).

MindsDB editor looks like this:

Now that we have setup the MindsDB, we will learn how to run our model in MindsDB in the next lesson.

Get ready for some serious fun with this project, y'all!
