# Letâ€™s Try our Yeezy Boy

So we are in the final lesson, keep the excitement high because we are just few steps away from having out very own AI bot which can mimic our fav character.

## Letâ€™s ignite our App

Run this command in your terminal set to the root folder `kanye-ai` to build your NextJS app (assuming that your Python server is running locally).

```
npx next build
```

Letâ€™s look at how the output will look like after this command.

Now we will kickstart our bot using the command `npm start`. Go to the given URL. You will see the AI bot like this (I have asked some questions to YeGPT as well!):

ðŸŽŠCongratulations you have successfully created your very own AI bot!

> **Note:** The response from the bot will take like 18-20 seconds as we are using the free instance of MindDB but if you wish to launch it, you should a paid instance which will respond faster!
