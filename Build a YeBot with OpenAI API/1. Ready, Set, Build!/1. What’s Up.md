# What’s Up?

Yo! Wat's good, everyone? We are Metaschool, and today we’re here to tell you about a course that's gonna blow your mind!

We're talking about a course where we're gonna teach you how to make your very own AI bot using the latest and greatest technology - the GPT-4 model. And not just any bot, we're talking about a bot that's gonna mimic the one and only, Kanye West.

Now, I know you're probably thinking, "Hey, why would I want to make a bot that sounds like Kayne?" Well, let me tell you, my friend, there's nothing cooler than having your own personal Kanye West AI bot spitting out fire tweets and dropping knowledge bombs like it's nobody's business!

Let me give you a sneak peek of the one and only YeBot that you're gonna build!

But don't take my word for it, you gotta try it out for yourself. We've got a live Kanye West AI bot on [this website](https://main--teal-elf-5fdf29.netlify.app/), that's already causing a stir. People can't get enough of it! So, before you even start this course, go check it out and see what all the fuss is about.

So, are you ready to step up and take on the challenge? Let's do this, fam! 

## Learning objectives

Throughout the course, we'll be learning about some crazy stuff, including:

1. Discovering what OpenAI API is and how it works – get ready to unleash your creativity with its insane tools.
2. Learning the fundamentals of OpenAI API and unlocking its full potential – no cap.
3. Playing with OpenAI Playground and writing your first few prompts – get ready to watch your ideas come to life!
4. Setting up the development environment and getting your hands on those OpenAI credentials – start building your dream projects like a pro!
5. Creating a simple GPT-4 model and witnessing the magic of AI-powered responses – it's gonna blow your mind!
6. Building a NextJS app and creating a local Python server API to connect the App with the model and get reply from Kanye himself – like, for real!

## Prerequisites

Learning new tech is always easier when you got some prior knowledge. So, before diving into OpenAI and AI model development, we recommend brushing up on the following:

1. API basics: It's super helpful if you got a basic understanding of APIs and how to use them.
2. Critical thinking: To wrap your head around the complex and abstract concepts in OpenAI and AI, you'll need some solid critical thinking skills.
3. Python installed: We assume that you have already installed python 3.8 in your system that can be used to run simple python programs.

But don't sweat it, my peeps – you can still learn OpenAI API and AI model development without knowing everything in advance. It's just gonna be way smoother if you got some background knowledge under your belt. So let's get learning, fam – it's gonna be lit!
