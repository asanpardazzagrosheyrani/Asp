# Let‚Äôs Wrap it Up

## üéäCONGRAGULATIONS!

Congratulations on completing this dope course and taking your AI development skills to the next level.

We just wrapped up a lit course on how to use OpenAI to make a bot that can act like Kanye West. Now, it's time to take a moment and go over all the dope stuff we learned in this course.

## You learned the basics of AI and OpenAI

At the start of this course, we learned how AI is revolutionising this modern world. We learned what OpenAI is and how OpenAI API is being used to build dope stuff. We wrote the python code and used OpenAI API to train our first model using prompts.

## You learned how to set up MindsDB

At the start of building the YeGPT, we got down to business and learned how to set up a database and API for the bot.

## You learned prompt engineering

After setting up the database and API for our bot, we got right into using MindsDB Cloud to train our model. We put our creativity to the test by adding Kanye personality to the bot and using prompts to make it sound more Kanye-like. And the best part is that the more we trained it, the better it got at coming up with responses that sounded just like Kanye himself!

## You learned to build an AI Bot

After we trained our AI bot using MindsDB Cloud, we learned how to make a frontend for our YeGPT using NextJS. We set up the Flask server to create an API and fetch data from MindsDB. We learned how we can use Flask to handle the responses of our YeGPT.

## You learned the power of AI

But, this course isn't just about making a bot that sounds like Kanye West. It's about understanding the power of AI and what it can do for you. MindsDB makes it easy to use machine learning and automate tasks, so you can spend more time doing what you love.

## Now what?

The potential of AI is limitless and we urge you to go out there and create your very own AI projects. Let‚Äôs look at some of the following project ideas that you can now build on your own.

1. Harry Potter AI bot that will take you to Harry Potter magical world.
2. Physics Tutor AI bot that will help you learn physics.
3. Albert Einstein AI bot that gives you some dope wisdom.
4. Luffy AI bot that will help you find One Piece! Isn‚Äôt it cool??

## ‚öíÔ∏è A small yet important request:

This is a 100% open-source project like all the other projects on our platform. You can find the tutorial markdown files [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/tree/main/Build%20a%20YeBot%20with%20OpenAI%20API). If you find any issues in the course, please feel free to resolve it. We, at Metaschool, love love love contributions by our community and acknowledge the contributors on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vbVMUwXWgc) and GitHub, too.

While you‚Äôre contributing:
