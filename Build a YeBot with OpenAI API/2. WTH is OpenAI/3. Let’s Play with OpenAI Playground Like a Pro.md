# Let’s Play with OpenAI Playground Like a Pro

Yo, let's talk about the OpenAI Playground, fam.

## What is OpenAI Playground?

It's a dope web-based interface that lets you experiment with OpenAI's latest language models without the need for coding, you feel me? It's designed to be easy and fun to use, so anyone can get into AI, no matter what their skills are.

## So, how does it work?

You enter text prompts, and the AI models generate new text based on them. There are different models to choose from, each with unique features and capabilities. That's what makes it so versatile.

You can use the Playground for all kinds of things, like creative writing, content creation, language learning, and even creating chatbots and virtual assistants. It's wild, right?

## Let’s get started

Now, to get started:

- You gotta create an account on the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) website.
- Click on your profile and then click on Manage account then click on Billing.
- Upgrade to a paid account. It's just a dollar a day, You can cancel whenever you want. (Individual paid account).
- Then head over to the [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) and let your creativity run wild.

Let’s look at the following animation on how you can perform the above given steps.

There are a few basic settings you gotta know about, like the prompt, model, temperature, and max tokens. But once you get the hang of it, you can use the Playground to generate all kinds of crazy stuff.

## Play with OpenAI Playground

And here's the best part: you can even make the Playground act like Kanye West. Just try out some of these prompts and see what comes out:

### Prompt #1

Reply as Kanye's style: "Hi, you are so kind and beautiful." 

**Output**

### Prompt #2

Reply as Kanye West: "What would you do if you come to Pakistan?" 

**Output**

### What are your thoughts?

The Playground generated short one line answers, where the answers were to the point. For each response we asked the Playground to act like Kanye West, but each response was general, as if a robot is answering my questions, not Kanye.

Let’s learn what are the limitations of Playground, that makes it not generate the effective answers.

## Limitations of Playground

- **Limited models**: So first off, there's only a few language models you can mess with in the Playground. You're not gonna get access to everything OpenAI's got.
- **Not so many features**: Compared to the API, the Playground is a little limited. You can only type in prompts and get responses, whereas the API has a bunch of extra features like fine-tuning and training the models for specific tasks. So if you want to take your skills to the next level, you gotta upgrade, ya feel me?
- **Limited control**: When it comes to tweaking the model settings, you're kinda stuck with the basics like temperature, max tokens, and frequency penalty. If you're looking for more customization, you gotta use the API or some other tool.
- **Usage limits**: Oh, and one more thing – there's a limit on how much you can use the Playground in an hour. So if you're using it a lot, keep that in mind, my dude.
- **Cannot train model:** Playground interface doesn’t allow us to train the models to our specific needs.

## Why we need to train our models using prompts

As the Playground is not effective, this is where code and prompts come in!

Prompts are the key to training a dope model. With code and prompts, you can give GPT specific cues on how to respond to certain inputs. This means you can get way more effective and predictable responses from your model.

In the next chapter, we will use code and prompts to train our model. We will train our model such that it will act like Kanye and give us the dope answers.
