# Into the World of Stacks

So hey folks, we just understood what is required to start this course. If you are here, it means you have a knack to learn something new. That new is yes, Stacks blockchain!!

# What the heck is Stacks blockchain

Stacks is an awesome blockchain technology that works hand-in-hand with Bitcoin to make smart contracts and decentralized apps a reality. It's like a layer of magic that brings together the power of Bitcoin and the creativity of developers. With Stacks, you can create amazing apps in a secure and reliable environment, where the strength of Bitcoin's security features merges seamlessly.  

The STX token is the native currency used on the Stacks blockchain to pay for gas fees required to execute transactions. The Clarity programming language is used to write smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, providing a simple and secure way for developers to create and deploy decentralized applications.

## How does Stacks even work

Imagine you and your neighbors have come together to create a community garden. To make the garden successful and sustainable, everyone needs to contribute and ensure its smooth operation.

1. **Staking**: Staking is similar to contributing resources and effort to the community garden. Here's how it relates:
a. **Acquiring stakes**: Just like you need to acquire STX tokens for staking, community members need to acquire stakes in the garden. These stakes represent their ownership and participation in the garden's success.
b. **Choosing a delegate**: In the community garden, there may be experienced gardeners who can take the responsibility of managing and overseeing the garden's operations. As a participant, you can choose a trusted delegate from the community who will lead the efforts and ensure the garden thrives.
c. **Delegating your stake**: Once you've chosen a delegate, you delegate a portion of your stakes to them. This means you entrust them with a certain amount of responsibility to make decisions and maintain the garden's well-being. By doing so, you contribute to the garden's success and security.
d. **Earning rewards**: As the garden grows and produces a bountiful harvest, the delegate recognizes the efforts of all participants. They distribute the rewards in the form of fresh produce, seeds, or even gardening tools. The more stakes you have delegated, the greater share of the rewards you receive.

1. **Mining**: Mining on the Stacks blockchain, or stacking, can be compared to an activity in the community garden called "harvesting parties." Here's how it relates:
a. **Setting up a harvesting group**: In the community garden, members can form a group to participate in harvesting parties. This group consists of volunteers who work together to collect ripe fruits and vegetables from the garden.
b. **Contributing to the harvest**: As a member of the harvesting group, you actively participate in the process. You help gather produce, sort it, and prepare it for distribution or personal use.

    c. **Sharing the rewards**: Once the harvest is complete, the group shares the rewards based on their contribution. This could be dividing the harvested produce among the group members or allocating extra resources, such as seeds or gardening supplies, to those who participated actively.
    d. **Reaping the benefits:** By joining the harvesting group and actively participating, you earn a share of the rewards. The more you contribute and participate in the harvesting parties, the more benefits you receive from the garden's yield.
    

In both staking and stacking, active participation and contribution are key to earning rewards and benefiting from the community garden or the Stacks blockchain. By aligning these concepts with a familiar scenario like a community garden, it becomes easier to understand the principles behind staking and mining.

## Wrap up

Overall, Stacks blockchain is an innovative platform that combines the security of Bitcoin with the flexibility of smart contracts. We explored mining and stacking with a real-world example to understand how Stacks work.

So, we covered the cool world of Stacks. Now we will also explore the awesome world of Clarity. üåê¬†Stay tuned ‚ÄºÔ∏è
