# Into the World of Tokens

Welcome back! So we completed coding and deploying Calculator on Stacks. Awesome, you did great! Well, in this lesson, we're going to learn about tokens! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Tokens

Blockchain technology serves as a foundation for representing, storing, and exchanging value among users through digital assets known as blockchain tokens. These tokens can be owned and verified by individuals on the blockchain. They operate under predefined rules set either by the blockchain itself (native tokens) or through smart contracts within the blockchain ecosystem. Cryptocurrency is a prominent example of blockchain token usage, showcasing the potential of this technology in facilitating secure and transparent transactions.

## Tokens in Clarity

In Clarity, tokens can be either fungible or non-fungible. Fungible tokens are interchangeable and have the same value, while non-fungible tokens are unique and have different values.

### Fungible tokens

In the context of the Stacks blockchain, a fungible token refers to a digital asset that is interchangeable with other tokens of the same type. Each unit of the token is identical and holds the same value as any other unit. This allows for seamless and uniform transactions within the blockchain ecosystem.

To understand fungible tokens, let's consider the example of a concert ticket. Imagine you're organizing a music festival and decide to issue digital tokens as tickets on the Stacks blockchain. Each token represents admission to the event and holds the same value.

In this case, each concert ticket token is fungible, meaning they are all identical and can be freely exchanged with one another. It doesn't matter which token you hold; as long as it's a valid concert ticket token, it grants you entry to the event. You can easily transfer or trade your ticket with someone else without any impact on its value or functionality.

### Fungible Tokens on the Stacks blockchain

Fungible tokens on the Stacks blockchain operate similarly. They represent digital assets that can be exchanged, traded, or transferred among users without any distinction between individual tokens. Each token is considered equal in value and function, providing a seamless experience for transactions and interactions within the blockchain network.

Fungible tokens are often used for currencies, where one unit is the same as any other unit. In Clarity, fungible tokens can be created using the `fungible-token` library. This library provides functions for creating, transferring, and burning tokens.

### Non-Fungible tokens

In contrast to fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Stacks blockchain represent unique and indivisible digital assets. Each NFT has distinct properties, making it different from any other token within the same collection. This uniqueness enables NFTs to represent one-of-a-kind items or digital assets in the blockchain ecosystem.

Continuing with our concert ticket example, let's imagine that instead of issuing fungible tokens, you decide to create non-fungible tokens to represent VIP passes for specific artists' meet-and-greet sessions at the music festival.

In this case, each VIP pass token is non-fungible, meaning it is unique and represents a specific opportunity to meet a particular artist. The tokens are distinguishable based on the artist, time slot, or other attributes associated with the meet-and-greet experience. Unlike fungible tokens, these VIP pass tokens cannot be freely exchanged with one another because each one holds different value and functionality.

As an attendee, if you own an NFT representing a VIP pass for a meet-and-greet with your favorite artist, that token cannot be interchanged with someone else's token for a different artist. Each NFT has its own distinct value and purpose.

### Non-fungible Tokens on the Stacks blockchain

Non-fungible tokens on the Stacks blockchain work similarly by providing a means to represent unique digital assets, such as digital art, collectibles, or even real-world assets.

Non-fungible tokens are unique and cannot be interchanged. They are often used for representing assets like real estate, digital art, or collectibles. In Clarity, non-fungible tokens can be created using the `non-fungible-token` library. This library provides functions for creating, transferring, and burning non-fungible tokens.

## Wrap up

That's it for our lesson on tokens! We've learned about the two types of tokens in Clarity, fungible and non-fungible, and how they can be used to represent and exchange value on the blockchain. 

Next, we will learn how to code BRC20 token. ðŸ”¥
