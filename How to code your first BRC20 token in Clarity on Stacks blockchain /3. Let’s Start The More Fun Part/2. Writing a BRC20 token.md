# Writing a BRC20 token

Welcome back!  So we completed learning about tokens. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to learn how to write a BRC20 token! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## BRC20 token

A BRC20 token is a kind of digital token that is fungible, meaning that each token is interchangeable and has the same value. BRC20 tokens can be implemented using Clarity's built-in fungible token functionality. The code for a basic BRC20 token contract includes functions for transferring tokens, minting new tokens, and retrieving token information such as the token name, symbol, and balance.

ERC20 tokens are developed by Ethereum and is a token standard for Ethereum network. On the other hand, BRC token is similar to ERC, it’s just that it’s deployed on bitcoin network so it’s called BRC. As **Stacks** is a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts, so we can make and deploy BRC token on Stacks.

In Clarity, traits are used to define the set of functions and constants that a contract needs to implement in order to conform to a specific interface or behavior. So fam, **Traits** in Clarity are super important to know so we can code BRC20 token. So let’s learn about it.

## Traits

They are similar to templates for smart contracts. Traits consist of public function definitions that specify names, input types, and output types. Similar to Solidity's interfaces, traits provide a means to define a standardized set of functionalities that contracts can implement.

For example, we have a contract `contract-one` having a trait names `trait-old` and it is deployed on mainnet. Another contract `contract-two` can point to `contract-one.trait-old`. Traits are super important when it comes to making calls between different parts of a computer program.

### Define and implement trait

We can define and implement a trait as:

```
;; Define a trait
(define-trait adder
    (
        (add (uint uint) (response uint uint))
    )
)

;; Implement the trait
(define-read-only (add (a uint) (b uint))
;; return 
    (ok (+ a b))
)
```

In the above code, `ok` is a keyword used in Clarity to indicate that a function has executed successfully and to return a value from that function. It is commonly used in read-only functions, where the return value is not stored on the blockchain.

The `impl-trait`  is a function call that declares that the contract implements the trait named `adder` , for above example it would be:

```
impl-trait .adder-trait.adder
```

## Write code for BRC20 token

Now go to the link of [Clarity Tools](https://clarity.tools/code/hello). Clear all the pre-written code and start writing the smart code there.

### Explanation

Let's start building the code line-by-line:

```
(impl-trait <insert-your-account-id>.contract-83714501649.sip-010-trait)
```

This line indicates that this code implements a trait. `contract-83714501649.sip-010-trait` is just name of the contract, so keep it as it is.

Replace `<insert-your-account-id>` with your Hiro’s wallet id.

```
(define-constant contract-owner tx-sender)

```

Here, we define a constant variable named `contract-owner` and assign it the value of the transaction sender. It represents the owner of the contract.

```
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))
(define-constant err-not-token-owner (err u101))
```

These lines define two error constants, `err-owner-only` and `err-not-token-owner`. These constants are used to represent specific error conditions that may occur during contract execution.

```
(define-fungible-token clarity-coin)
```

This line defines a fungible token named `clarity-coin`. 

```
(define-public (transfer (amount uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal) (memo (optional (buff 34))))
    (begin
        (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender sender) err-not-token-owner)
        (try! (ft-transfer? clarity-coin amount sender recipient))
        (match memo to-print (print to-print) 0x)
        (ok true)))
```

Here, we define a public function named `transfer` that allows users to transfer tokens. It takes in the amount to be transferred, the sender and recipient addresses, and an optional memo. Inside the function, we perform several actions such as asserting that the transaction sender is the token owner, attempting to transfer the specified amount of tokens using the `ft-transfer` function, printing the memo if it is printable, and finally returning `true` to indicate a successful transfer.

```
(define-read-only (get-name)
    (ok "Clarity Coin"))
```

This function, `get-name`, is a read-only function that returns the name of the token, which in this case is `Clarity Coin`.

```
(define-read-only (get-symbol)
    (ok "CC"))
```

Similarly, the `get-symbol` function is a read-only function that returns the symbol of the token, which is `CC`.

```
(define-read-only (get-decimals)
    (ok u6))
```

The `get-decimals` function returns the number of decimal places for token balances, which in this case is represented by `u6`.

```
(define-read-only (get-balance (who principal))
    (ok (ft-get-balance clarity-coin who)))
```

This read-only function, `get-balance`, takes a principal address as an argument and returns the token balance of that address using the `ft-get-balance` function.

```
(define-read-only (get-total-supply)
    (ok (ft-get-supply clarity-coin)))
```

The `get-total-supply` function is a read-only function that returns the total token supply using the `ft-get-supply` function.

```
(define-read-only (get-token-uri)
    (ok none))
```

This function, `get-token-uri`, is a read-only function that returns the URI associated with the token. In this case, it returns `none` since there is no token URI defined.

## Complete code

The complete code is: 

```
(impl-trait 'ST13W323H99GMQD320C2VC6WTQG9TTK3JRV1N5AQR.contract-83714501649.sip-010-trait)

;; the value of the transaction sender.
(define-constant contract-owner tx-sender)

;; Defines an error constant "err-owner-only" with a 
;; value of "u100" (user-defined error code).
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))

;; Defines an error constant "err-not-token-owner" with 
;; a value of "u101" (user-defined error code).
(define-constant err-not-token-owner (err u101))

;; Defines a fungible token named "clarity-coin".
(define-fungible-token clarity-coin)

;; Defines a public function "transfer" for transferring tokens 
;; between senders and recipients.
(define-public (transfer (amount uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal) (memo (optional (buff 34))))
    (begin
        ;; Checks if the transaction sender is the token owner; 
				;; otherwise, throws an error.
        (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender sender) err-not-token-owner)
        ;; Tries to transfer the specified amount of tokens from 
				;; the sender to the recipient.
        (try! (ft-transfer? clarity-coin amount sender recipient))
        ;; Matches the "memo" argument and prints it if it's a printable string.
        (match memo to-print (print to-print) 0x)
        ;; Returns "true" to indicate a successful transfer.
        (ok true)))

;; Defines a read-only function "get-name" to retrieve the name of the token.
(define-read-only (get-name)
    ;; Returns the name "Clarity Coin".
    (ok "Clarity Coin"))

;; Defines a read-only function "get-symbol" to retrieve the symbol of the token.
(define-read-only (get-symbol)
    ;; Returns the symbol "CC".
    (ok "CC"))

;; Defines a read-only function "get-decimals" to retrieve 
;; the decimal places for token balances.
(define-read-only (get-decimals)
    ;; Returns the number of decimal places as "u6".
    (ok u6))

;; Defines a read-only function "get-balance" to retrieve 
;; the token balance of a given principal.
(define-read-only (get-balance (who principal))
    ;; Returns the token balance for the specified principal.
    (ok (ft-get-balance clarity-coin who)))

;; Defines a read-only function "get-total-supply" to 
;; retrieve the total token supply.
(define-read-only (get-total-supply)
    ;; Returns the total token supply.
    (ok (ft-get-supply clarity-coin)))

;; Defines a read-only function "get-token-uri" to 
;; retrieve the URI associated with the token.
(define-read-only (get-token-uri)
    ;; Returns "none" as there is no token URI defined.
    (ok none))

;; Defines a public function "mint" to create new tokens 
;; and assign them to a recipient.
(define-public (mint (amount uint) (recipient principal))
    (begin
        ;; Checks if the transaction sender is the contract owner; 
				;; otherwise, throws an error.
        (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender contract-owner) err-owner-only)
        ;; Mints the specified amount of tokens and assigns 
				;; them to the recipient.
        (ft-mint? clarity-coin amount recipient)))
```

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned how to write a BRC20 token in Clarity. We discussed the importance of traits and how they are similar to templates for smart contracts. We also went through the code line-by-line and explained how each function works. Finally, we provided the complete code for a basic BRC20 token contract.

Now that we've learned about tokens and how to code them, we're ready to deploy and interact with them. Stay tuned for the next lesson!
