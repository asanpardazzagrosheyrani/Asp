# Deploying and Interacting With BRC20 Token

Welcome back!  So we completed learning about writing our first token contract. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to deploy and interact with BRC20 token! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Deploy the contract

Copy the complete code and head over to [Stacks Explorer Sandbox](https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/deploy?chain=testnet). Paste the code, name your contract and hit the Deploy button.

Hit the Confirm button and wait for 10-15 minutes for it be deployed.

Once, it is deployed you will see a window similar to this:

## Interact with your contract

After this, go to Available functions and interact with your desired functions:

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned how to deploy and interact with a BRC20 token. First, we deployed the contract by copying the code and pasting it into the Stacks Explorer Sandbox. After confirming the deployment, we waited for the contract to be deployed and then we were able to interact with it using the available functions. This was a great hands-on experience that will prepare you for working with tokens in the real world. Keep up the good work! 

Next, we will conclude our quick course.
