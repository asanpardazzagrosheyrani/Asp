# Let’s Wrap It Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! 🎉 It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Get ready for a quick recap that will leave you feeling accomplished and ready to conquer the world! 

## Setting up the Development Environment

You set up the development environment and installed all the necessary dependencies. You learned how to:

- set up the testnet environment
- connect your Metamask wallet
- fetch fake MATIC
- set Hardhat project
- secure private data
- create an API key for PolygonScan
- set up Chainlink

## Writing smart contracts

You wrote `HogwartsNFT.sol` that allows the owner to mint non-fungible tokens representing the four Hogwarts houses. And you also wrote `RandomHouseAssignment.sol` to randomly assign Hogwarts houses to users. You used Chainlink's VRF service to generate random numbers, and then minted an NFT for the user with the randomly assigned house.

## Compiling the contracts

You wrote the deploy scripts and update the necessary files to compile the contracts.

## Adding frontend

You added frontend to your dApp, learned to integrate the frontend with the backend (smart contracts) and interacted with it.

## 🎊 Congratulations

You have completed the tutorial and are now equipped with the knowledge to create a dApp.

WAGMI! Peace out! ✌🏻🔮
