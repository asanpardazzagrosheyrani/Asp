# Reasons for Building on Aptos

### Scalability through parallelization and modularity

Aptos is a super speedy Layer 1 blockchain that's all about handling a ton of transactions at once without breaking a sweat. It does this magic through something called parallel execution, where it processes multiple transactions at the same time, as long as they don’t step on each other's toes.

In simpler terms, Aptos boosts its ability to handle lots of activity by doing two main things: parallelization and modularity.

So, parallel execution is at the heart of what makes Aptos tick. It uses a special setup that allows different transactions to run side by side without interfering. This means the system can handle a lot more at once compared to doing everything one by one.

Then, there's modularity. Aptos breaks down the transaction process into different parts that can work on their own. This not only makes things more flexible but also more efficient. For example, those who validate transactions, like checking your movie ticket at the theater, can pick the transactions with higher fees first, letting the smaller ones wait a bit.

All in all, these features help Aptos achieve super-fast processing times and handle a lot more transactions than your typical blockchain.

### Move - the core behind Aptos’ security

Aptos uses a programming language called Move, and it’s a bit like the superhero of coding languages when it comes to safety and security. Move comes packed with features that help it automatically spot any sneaky or harmful smart contracts trying to stir up trouble.

Another cool tool in Move’s belt is something called formal verification. This is basically using some serious math to double-check that everything a program is supposed to do is spot on, without any errors.

So, by using Move, Aptos is really focusing on keeping things secure. It’s like having a really good security system in place to make sure everything runs smoothly and safely.

### Upgradability and on-chain governance

Aptos is built with a cool modular architecture, which basically means it’s super flexible and easy to upgrade. This setup helps users keep up with the ever-changing Web3 world more smoothly, without much hassle or downtime.

What’s more, Aptos takes upgrading to the next level with its on-chain governance system. This system lets people who hold tokens have a say in protocol upgrades through voting.

It's like having a say in how your favorite online platform evolves, which is something we’ve always wanted in Web3, right? Aptos really delivers on that front, making it easier for everyone to stay up-to-date and secure.

### Developer experience and tooling ecosystem

Aptos really rolls out the red carpet for developers with its impressive set of tools and resources. Whether you’re looking to whip up some smart contracts or craft your very own decentralized app (DApp), Aptos has got you covered with everything you need to make the process smooth and straightforward.
