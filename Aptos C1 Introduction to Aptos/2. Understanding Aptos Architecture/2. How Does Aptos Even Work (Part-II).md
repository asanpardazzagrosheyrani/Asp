# How Does Aptos Even Work? (Part-II)

Welcome back, folks!! I see you are here for some more knowledge on how Aptos works. Well, we covered a bunch of things in the previous lesson like Aptos core principles, Move language, and logical data model and transaction lifecycle in Aptos.

Next up, we need to understand how these transactions get processed in the Aptos blockchain. So letâ€™s move and learn~

## Aptos parallel execution model and data partitioning

Aptos is like a super-efficient machine, processing transactions in stages to boost speed and performance. Each stage is independent and can run in parallel, just like the high-tech processors in modern computers. This not only speeds things up but also opens the door for new ways validators and clients can interact. Aptos combines smart parallel execution model with intelligent data partitioning to offer blazing-fast transaction processing.

### **Parallel execution model**

Hereâ€™s how the parallel execution model works in Aptos.

1. **Batch Processing**: Transactions are grouped into batches by validators, and then combined into blocks during consensus. This grouping helps optimize operations, reduce duplicate tasks, and enable parallel execution.
2. **Continuous Transaction Dissemination**: Validators continuously share batches of transactions, ensuring that at least a majority of honest validators store the batch before execution. This prevents denial-of-service attacks and ensures data availability.
3. **Block Metadata Ordering**: Unlike traditional blockchains where consensus slows things down, Aptos separates tasks like transaction dissemination, execution/storage, and ledger certification. This separation allows for high throughput and minimal latency.
4. **Parallel Transaction Execution**: Transactions within a block can be executed in parallel. Even transactions modifying the same data can be processed concurrently using a concept called delta writes, which tracks modifications rather than final states. This approach maximizes efficiency without compromising on determinism.

### **Data partitioning**

Hereâ€™s how the data partitioning works in Aptos.

- **Parallel Data Model**: Aptos' Move data model supports global addressing, allowing non-conflicting transactions to execute in parallel. Even when conflicts arise, innovative strategies reduce these conflicts, improving concurrency.
- **Batch Storage**: After parallel execution, write sets (changes to the blockchain state) are stored temporarily in memory. This caching method speeds up subsequent operations and reduces redundant storage operations.

In a nutshell,  It's like having a super-efficient factory where tasks are divided, processed simultaneously, and assembled seamlessly!

Now we have understood very well how transactions are being processed in Aptos. One lingering question remains: Who accepts and validates these transactions on the blockchain? For this, we have a validator. But Aptos offers a unique style of mechanism that allows validators to accept or reject the transaction. To understand this letâ€™s dive into understanding what consensus mechanism Aptos uses.

## Consensus mechanism in Aptos blockchain

The Aptos blockchain uses a unique combination of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) for its consensus mechanism. Let's unpack what that means.

### Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

In a PoS system, validators are selected to validate transactions based on the number of tokens they stake or lock up. The more tokens a validator stakes, the more weight their vote carries in the consensus process. This encourages validators to act honestly because they have a financial stake in the network's integrity. Just like imagine a shareholder voting system where shareholders with more shares have a greater say in company decisions, incentivizing them to act in the company's best interest to protect their investment.

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

BFT is like the blockchain's immune system against bad actors. Even if some validators act maliciously or make mistakes, the system can still reach a consensus on valid transactions. This ensures the blockchain keeps running smoothly and securely.

### Validator Participation and Rewards

Validators in the Aptos blockchain have to meet a minimum staking requirement to participate in the consensus process. If they don't meet this requirement, they become inactive but can still sync with the blockchain state or rejoin later.

Validators and stakers share rewards based on a pre-agreed split. At the end of each epoch (a set period), rewards are distributed to validators and their stakers via on-chain Move modules.

### Flexible Participation

One of the great things about the Aptos blockchain is its flexibility. Any validator with sufficient stake can join the network. Plus, all the parameters, like the minimum stake required, can be set through on-chain processes, making the system adaptable and community-driven.

So, there you have it! The Aptos blockchain's consensus mechanism combines the stake-based selection of validators with Byzantine Fault Tolerance to create a robust, secure, and flexible system. Validators and stakers work together to maintain the network, and everyone benefits from the rewards. It's a win-win for everyone involved!

## Performance

As you have gone through in detail how Aptos works. Letâ€™s quickly go through how the architecture of Aptos improves its performance.

- **Speedy Transactions**: Aptos is designed to handle a bunch of transactions at once, thanks to its parallel processing. It's like having multiple lanes on a highway, so traffic moves smoothly.
- **Efficient Hardware Use**: It's not just fast; it's smart too! Aptos uses its hardware in the best possible way, making sure nothing goes to waste.
- **Always Improving**: The team behind Aptos is always on the lookout for ways to make it even better. Whether it's tweaking how the network agrees on things or making small updates to speed things up, they're on it.
- **Real-World Testing**: Instead of just focusing on how many transactions it can do in a lab, Aptos looks at how it performs in real-world situations. This means better, more practical results.
- **Freedom for Developers**: Aptos lets developers get creative without restrictions. Whether they're working on a simple transaction or something more complex, Aptos supports it without slowing down.
- **Balancing Act**: While Aptos can handle a lot, there's always a balance to maintain. Adding more validators or splitting tasks can boost performance, but it also comes with challenges. Think of it like adding more chefs to a kitchen; too many, and things might get chaotic!
- **Growing Smartly**: Like how cloud services use serverless databases to manage complex systems, Aptos aims to grow efficiently without overcomplicating things. It's all about finding the sweet spot between speed, cost, and complexity.

## Wrap up

Aptos is a fast and flexible blockchain using a proof-of-stake system with Byzantine fault tolerance. It's built for speed with parallel processing, making transactions quick and efficient. Developers love its freedom to innovate. And, as it grows, it aims to keep that balance of speed, cost, and complexity just right. In short, Aptos is the future of decentralized tech! ðŸ˜Ž
