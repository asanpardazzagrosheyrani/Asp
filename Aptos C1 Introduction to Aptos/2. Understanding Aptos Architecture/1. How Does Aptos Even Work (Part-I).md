# How Does Aptos Even Work? (Part-I)

Welcome back, folks!! I see you are here for some more knowledge.

So far you have learned how the Aptos came into being, what is it exactly, and what work has been done on the Aptos blockchain. But how does Aptos blockchain even work?

Whenever we start working with any blockchain technology, after learning what is it and how it is making an impact in the world we, as developers, always try to learn how the team has built the architecture of the blockchain. Our curious minds always make us wonder how things are working at a deeper level in an ecosystem.

As in this course we are talking about Aptos, in this lesson, we will take you through how Aptos is working at its core level. So, tighten your seat belt and take this wild ride with us.

## Overview of Aptos core design principles

Let‚Äôs take a bird‚Äôs eye view and identify the core design principle of the Aptos blockchain:

1. The Validators in Aptos are the trustworthy gatekeepers responsible for confirming and validating transactions on the blockchain network. They use a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus with a proof-of-stake mechanism to confirm transactions. This consensus mechanism  is a really solid pick when it comes to robustness even in the face of network disruptions or malicious actors.
2. Both full nodes and light clients are the historians of the blockchain. They keep track of the blockchain's history and current state. Full nodes get all the details directly from the validators or other full nodes, while light clients focus on essential info.
3. Smart contracts that run on the Aptos blockchain are lightning-fast and super secure, thanks to the Move programming language. It's designed to make things smooth and straightforward.
4. Aptos handles transactions like a pro, using batched, pipelined, and parallel methods. This means it can process a ton of transactions quickly without breaking a sweat.
5. Here's where it gets interesting: Aptos uses a cool technique called Block-STM for parallel transaction processing. It handles complex transactions smoothly without needing to know everything upfront.
6. Aptos is always on its toes, tweaking performance and decentralization by regularly shuffling its validator set and keeping an eye on reputations.
7. Keeping up with the times is crucial, so Aptos is built to adapt to new tech and use cases as they come along.
8. The modular setup of Aptos is a real gem. It lets developers test each part individually, making sure everything's as secure as Fort Knox.

Here‚Äôs the high-level diagram presented by the Aptos team in the [Aptos whitepaper](https://aptosfoundation.org/whitepaper/aptos-whitepaper_en.pdf) to show the workings of the Aptos blockchain.

This might seem like a lot to take in , But don‚Äôt worry we will be going through them step by step and explain everything in detail. 

## The Move programming language

Move is a cutting-edge smart contract programming language designed with safety and flexibility at its core. It's the star language powering the Aptos blockchain and helps developers to interact with the Aptos blockchain, which is pretty cool!

But, why is Move so special? Well, it borrows some awesome features from Rust, another popular programming language and then goes full Solo-leveling all the way to Rank S üéñÔ∏è. It's designed with crystal-clear data ownership using concepts like linear types, ensuring that resources like Coins are managed securely with the right permissions.

The Aptos blockchain uses Move to handle its ledger state. This includes everything from user accounts to the blockchain's configuration details. Users can interact with the blockchain by submitting transactions. These transactions can do things like creating new modules, upgrading existing ones, or executing specific functions within these modules.

But safety is a big deal in the crypto world, right? That's where Move shines even brighter. It uses a bytecode verifier to ensure type and memory safety, even when dealing with potentially risky code. Plus, it has the Move Prover, a formal verifier that checks if a Move program works as intended.

Aptos and Move make a dynamic duo, enhancing versatility and performance. From supporting web3 use cases to offering fine-grained resource control and handling massive datasets like NFTs, they cover it all. Plus, seamless upgrades and shared accounts make collaboration and management effortless for decentralized organizations (DAOs) and beyond.

So, in a nutshell, Move and Aptos together offer a secure, flexible, and powerful platform for blockchain development. How's that for a quick rundown?

## Logical data model and transaction lifecycle

Alright, Move help us in writing smart contracts. Great ! But how Aptos does manage the accounts and transactions in its architecture. To understand this let‚Äôs talk a bit about the logical data model in Aptos first.

### Logical Data Model:

The Aptos blockchain uses a ledger to keep track of all account states. Each account has a unique 256-bit address. The ledger state is versioned based on the number of transactions processed. When a transaction occurs, it generates an output that includes operations to modify the ledger (write sets), events, gas consumed, and transaction status.

- **Accounts**: Identified by unique 256-bit addresses, created by transaction initiation.
- **Modules**: Pieces of code on the blockchain, reusable across different applications.
- **Resources**: Data values associated with account addresses, managed by modules.

### Transaction Lifecycle and Processing:

Transactions on Aptos are like sending a letter; it has three main parties involved: a sender, a recipient, and a message. It involved multiple steps to perform a single transaction in Aptos. They are as follows:

1. **Signed Transaction**: When you want to send a transaction, you create a signed message. This message includes details like who's sending it, what it's for, how much you're willing to pay for it (in gas), and when it expires.
2. **Execution**: Once you send your message, the system processes it using the current ledger state. This process updates the ledger, like updating your bank balance after making a withdrawal.
3. **Events**: As your transaction goes through, it can send out notifications, or events. These events can be things like "Tokens Sent" or "Tokens Received." They're like the confirmations you get for online orders.
4. **Account Creation**: If you try to send tokens to an address that doesn't have an account yet, a new account gets created. Think of it as setting up a new email address when someone sends you an email for the first time.
5. **Move Modules**: These are toolkits for developers. They contain predefined functions and data types, making it easier to build new features or applications on Aptos.
6. **Ledger State**: This is the real-time snapshot of the entire system. It's stored in a specific format that makes it efficient to access and update. It's like the database behind the scenes, keeping everything in order.

So, in a nutshell, Aptos uses a logical data model to manage all its accounts and transactions, making sure everything runs smoothly and securely on the blockchain.

## Wrap up

The lesson gives a snapshot of Aptos's core principles: strong validators, fast transactions with Move, and smooth transaction management. It also explains how transactions work on Aptos, ensuring security and efficiency. Overall, it shows why Aptos is a solid choice for blockchain development.
