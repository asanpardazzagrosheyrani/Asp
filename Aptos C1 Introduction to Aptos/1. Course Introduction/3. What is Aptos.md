# What is Aptos?

Welcome back, my friend! Since you've chosen to dive into this course, you probably already know how quickly blockchain technology has skyrocketed. But have you ever stopped to think why it’s grown so fast, especially compared to other tech like the internet which took ages to catch on? It's pretty intriguing, right?

The magic of blockchain starts with some key features you've probably heard about while Googling around: decentralization and transparency. Impressive as these features are, they alone aren't enough to thrust blockchain into the mainstream. Why? Well, blockchains are notoriously slow and costly. In an era where we might ditch a website just because it loads slowly, speed and cost become big barriers when it comes to adopting new tech.

What's the best fix for this? A blockchain that's quicker, cheaper, and can scale up. And that brings us to why we're here—yes, the Aptos blockchain. You might be wondering what makes Aptos stand out. Well, Let’s Just jump right in and explore the key features that make the Aptos blockchain so unique and why it's catching the attention of developers everywhere.

## Key Features of Aptos

Here are some key features which make Aptos blockchain stand out among the crowd of blockchains that exist in web3:

1. **Move Language Integration**: Aptos uses the Move language for rapid and secure transaction execution. It ensures protection against malicious activities and increases overall security as well.
2. **High Throughput & Low Latency**: Aptos achieves a high throughput as it utilizes a pipelined transaction processing approach. What this means is that, it breaks down the transaction execution process into multiple stages that can be executed in parallel. Although each stage of the transaction process operates independently, they passing data or results from one stage to another. 
3. **Atomic Transaction Support**: As we mentioned, the transactions in Aptos are broken down into multiple stages. Now atomic transaction support ensures that even if any one of these transactions that are broken down into stages fails, the entire transaction fails and that there is no state change in the blockchain. 
4. **Modular Architecture & Upgradability**: Aptos is a modular blockchain, meaning it is made up of it's made up of independent parts or modules. Now unlike other blockchains where the whole system suffers during and upgrade, in Aptos, you can update specific modules or components which makes the upgrade process much more faster and more efficient.
5. **Scalability Initiatives**: Aptos is working on ways to handle more transactions and grow its capacity without making things more complicated for the nodes that operate the network by using techniques like internal and state sharding wherein, instead of relying solely on individual validators (nodes) to handle all transactions, Aptos divides the workload among multiple validators or shards.
6. **Flexible Data Model:** Aptos allows you to manage your keys in flexible ways. This means users have options to choose how they want to store and use their keys, whether through software wallets, hardware wallets, or other methods. It also provides users with choices when it comes to custody of their assets. Users can opt for self-custody, where they manage their keys independently, or choose custodial services provided by trusted third parties such as exchanges or wallet providers.

## That’s a wrap

We hope this gives you a good snapshot of what Aptos is all about and the standout features it brings to the table. Next up, we’ll explore some of the popular Dapps that have been built on Aptos. Stay tuned to see how developers are leveraging Aptos to create cool applications!
