# Setup MetaMask and Remix

Welcome back!  So you completed leaning about Avalanche. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to learn how to set up the dev environment for running our code. We will set up MetaMask and Remix now! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## What is development environment?

We now need a super cool environment to run our code in and we need to set it up!

For this tutorial, we will use MetaMask wallet, AVAX faucet, and then Remix for compiling and deploying our token. Don’t worry, setting them is super easy and you will do it no time!

## Setup Metamask

I assume you have already setup MetaMask in your system. Now, I will walk you through setting up the Avalanche network in your MetaMask wallet.

### Steps

1. Open your MetaMask browser extension, scroll through networks and click on “Add Network” button.

The following screen will appear after clicking the “Add Network” button.

1. Now click on the “Add a network manually” to add a new network to your MetaMask.

1. Now fill in the following details and click on “Save”.
    1. **Network name**: Avalanche C-Chain
    2. **New RPC URL**: [https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc](https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc)
    3. **Chain ID**: `43113`
    4. **Currency symbol**: AVAX
    5. **Block explorer URL**: [https://testnet.snowtrace.io](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)
2. The following screen will appear after clicking on the “Save” button. Finally, click on “Switch to Avalanche C-Chain” button and switch to your newly added network.

## Fill your account with AVAX

Next we will fill our newly created Avalanche account with AVAX using faucet. Here’s how you can do that:

### Steps

1. Copy your Avalanche account address.

1. Next, head over to [https://faucet.avax.network/](https://faucet.avax.network/), paste your copied address to the Address field and click on “Request 2 AVAX” button.

In next 2-5 minutes your wallet will be filled with 2 AVAX. 🎊

## What is Remix?

Remix is like an all-in-one toolbox for developers, and it stands for Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Here's the deal: Remix is all about making your life easier when you're working on creating smart contracts. It's open-source, which means it's free for everyone to use and improve. It's like having a special workspace just for writing and running programs in Solidity programming language.

## Setup Remix

Head over to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and click on “New File” button. Set the name of your file as `MyCrypto.sol`.

That’s pretty much it for now!

## That’s a wrap

In next lesson, you will write ERC20 token in Solidity programming language that you will deploy on your Avalanche network using Remix IDE.
