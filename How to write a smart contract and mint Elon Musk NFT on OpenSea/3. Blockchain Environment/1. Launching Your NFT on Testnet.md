# Launching Your NFT on Testnet

Great work on coming so far! So far, we were working locally, deploying our NFT into the local server. Now, we will learn how we can deploy our NFT to the blockchain network. For this course, we will use Polygon because it has a great marketplace for NFTs.

## Get started with setting up the testnet network

So, yeah, you must be wondering. I can write, compile and test my smart contract all day on my own computer but how do I connect to the ethereum network?

Do I have to set up my own ethereum node on my server?

Won’t that be too complicated?

The answer to all those questions is - [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

## Get Alchemy HTTP link

Please follow the following steps to get the HTTP link. We will use this link in our config file to connect our app to the Mumbai network.

1. Login to your Alchemy account or create a new account.
2. Go to this link: [https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps).
3. Create new app.
4. Select “Polygon PoS” as your Chain.
5. Choose “Polygon Mumbai” as your Network.
6. Name your app and write description.
7. After creating the app, click on “Create app”. Here’s the GIF for you to follow the steps easily.

9. Copy both of these links as we will use these later.

## Create MetaMask wallet

Your metamask wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a MetaMask account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap, and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.

MetaMask has a mobile application and a Chrome browser extension too. I personally use MetaMask on my Chrome browser extension because I do most of the work on my laptop.

Anyways, let’s go!

Here are the installation steps:

- Go to [MetaMask.io](http://metamask.io/).
- Click Download and Install the Chrome Extension.
- Setup your secure password.
- The next step is the most important one.
- Secure your 12-word phrase properly, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

Congrats! Your account is created and you must have received a public address. The public address will be in the pattern of:

_Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_

You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store Ethereum based tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?

Yes, it is completely safe. You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store Ethereum based crypto.

### Set up the testnet environment

Complete the following steps:

- Head over to [https://chainlist.org/chain/80001](https://chainlist.org/chain/80001).
- Click on “Connect Wallet”.
- Click on Next, then Connect, then Approve, and finally Switch Network.
- After connecting your wallet, click on “Add to Metamask”.
- Click on Approve and then Switch network.

You will be successfully connected to Mumbai network. See in the following gif how I did it where my wallet is already connected:

### Get some fake MATIC $$

Now its time to get some money!

- Copy your account address.
- Head over to [https://mumbaifaucet.com/](https://mumbaifaucet.com/).
- Login to your Alchemy account.
- Paste your wallet address and click on “Send me MATIC” button.

## Get your private MetaMask key

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

1. Open the metamask extension to find your private key.
2. Click on Account.
3. Click on 3 dots on right side and go to “Account Details”.
4. Click on “Show private key”.
5. Enter Metamask password.
6. Copy your private key.

![Frame 3560364 (4).gif](<https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/Add-GIFs-DAO/assests_for_all/How%20to%20write%20a%20smart%20contract%20and%20mint%20Elon%20Musk%20NFT%20on%20OpenSea/Launching%20Your%20NFT%20on%20Testnet/Frame_3560364_(4).gif?raw=true>)

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export the private key and paste it somewhere secure.

DON’T COMMIT YOUR PRIVATE KEY ON GITHUB, DON’T SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON’T SHARE IT ANYWHERE!

IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!

## Getting Ready for Deployment

First let’s do some basic housekeeping stuff. We know that there are massive scams and security issues happening in the crypto world. You make a mistake and it can cost you a life time.

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. In order to avoid this issue. Let’s do the following.

```
npm install dotenv --save --force
touch .gitignore
```

Now go ahead and create .env file at the base of your project. Open your `.gitignore` file and write `.env` there.

All the secrets and important keys related to your project will be stored in `.env` file and we can access this data whenever and wherever. In the gitignore file we simply write `.env`, it tells git to ignore that file from future commits.

Open the `.env` file you have just created. Add your Metamask Private Key and Alchemy App HTTP URL there. Should be something like this.

```
API_URL_KEY="YOUR_ALCHEMY_APP_HTTP_URL"
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY"
API_KEY="YOUR_ALCHEMY_APP_KEY"
```

We have gotten most of the things set up already we just have to take care of two little things for now. Next, we will install `Ethers.js` library.

`Ethers.js` is a very popular library, that makes it easy for us to interact with the ethereum network. We will be using this library to deploy our smart contract.

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers --force
```

To interact with ethereum, we will also need to set up the network we are using to do so. This tutorial is built on the mumbai test network which allows developers to test out there software without spending real eth.

## Updating Hardhat Config file

So go to your `hardhat.config.js` file and copy the following settings into it.

```
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("dotenv").config();

const { API_URL_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
  defaultNetwork: "mumbai",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    mumbai: {
      url: API_URL_KEY,
      accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],
    },
  },
};

```

### Understanding the code

This code exports a configuration object for the Hardhat Ethereum development framework.

The dotenv library is being used to load environment variables from a .env file, which allows sensitive information such as private keys to be stored in a separate file that is ignored by version control.

The `API_URL_KEY` and `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variables are being restructured and assigned to constants.

The configuration object sets the Solidity version to be used as 0.8.17, sets the default network to Mumbai testnet network, and defines network configurations for the hardhat and Mumbai network. The Mumbai network configuration specifies the URL of the Polygon client to connect to and the private keys of the accounts that will be available for use in transactions.

So to check if everything is working properly let’s quickly compile our contract using hardhat.

```
npx hardhat compile
```

The output of the above command will be similar to below:

![Frame 3560364 (29).jpg](<https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/Add-GIFs-DAO/assests_for_all/How%20to%20write%20a%20smart%20contract%20and%20mint%20Elon%20Musk%20NFT%20on%20OpenSea/Launching%20Your%20NFT%20on%20Testnet/Frame_3560364_(29).jpg?raw=true>)

You should be able to see a newly created `artifacts` folder inside your directory. Keep an eye out for this, because we’ll be using this pretty soon.

## Deployment script

First, let’s update our deployment script a bit. Replace your `scripts/run.js` code with the following code.

```
async function main() {
  const ElonNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("ElonNFT");
  console.log("Deploying Contract...");
  const elon = await ElonNFT.deploy();
  const txHash = elon.deployTransaction.hash;
  const txReceipt = await ethers.provider.waitForTransaction(txHash);
  console.log("Contract deployed to address:", txReceipt.contractAddress);
  console.log("Minting NFT...");
  let txn = await elon.mintNFT();
  await txn.wait();
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Here, we are using `deployTransaction` to pay for the transaction fees. `deployTransaction` is used to fetch the transaction fee from your wallet because without any transaction fee, contract does not get deployed to your wallet.

`txReceipt.contractAddress` is used to fetch the contract address after transaction has been successfully completed.

## Run deployment command

Now you are ready to deploy your contract to Polygon Mumbai Network. Wohoo!! The command is almost same as before but now you will mention the mumbai network where you are deploying your contract.

Let's run the command in our terminal and run this project.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js --network mumbai
```

Congratulations you have just deployed your own smart contract to the ethereum test network!

Store this contract address somewhere. We will need it later.

At this point I would recommend taking a step back and appreciating what you have done here. 👏

## Viewing your NFT in polygonscan

Go to the [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) and paste in your contract address. View your transaction details here, click on your transaction hash to understand the elements that were involved in your transaction. I’ll show you mine.

You will probably be using polygonscan a lot in the future, so it would be helpful to get yourself familiar with it :)

## Viewing your NFT in Opensea

There is an Opensea testnet as well. Here is the [link to that.](https://testnets.opensea.io/) You can checkout your minted NFT there as well. Just copy paste the address where you minted your NFT. We minted the NFT to your metamask wallet address. So just copy-paste that address in testnet Opensea and see if you can find your NFT. BOOOMMMM!!!! Here is mine.

## Viewing your NFTs in MetaMask

To view your NFTs in your MetaMask account.

- Go to metamask’s mobile app.
- Import your current MetaMask wallet using the recovery phrase.
- And then click on import NFTs.
- Enter your contract address and tokenID (you can find this on polygonscan) of the NFT minted here.
- Refresh MetaMask a few times, and you now have your own NFT!

And now, all I've got to say is well, well, well done! We have one ☝ last step left, which is, deploying the contract on Production Network, and that's coming up next.
