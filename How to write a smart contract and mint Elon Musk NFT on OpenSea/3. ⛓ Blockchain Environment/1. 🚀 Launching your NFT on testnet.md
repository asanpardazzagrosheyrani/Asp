# Launching your NFT on testnet

As NFTschool, describes it.

"There are three environments for a blockchain network: mainnet, devnet, and testnet.

## Devnet

Till now we were using the local development network to run our smart contracts. This is the easiest and fastest way to get started, iterate and run things without having to setup tons of stuff. For setting up devnet, we used Hardhat that provided us a local Ethereum like blockchain environment. Remember at the start of this project, I mentioned, how every time we deploy a smart contract it is a start from scratch. Now we are being promoted. Since we have setup a basic contract which we believe can run. We will use a testnet environment.

## Testnet

Because devnets are a simplified simulation of the real network, they don't always behave in quite the same way. This is a good thing when you want fast development cycles, but not so great when you want to know how your contract will actually work on mainnet.

For that, you can deploy and run your contract on a test network, or _testnet_. These networks generally run the same code as the mainnet, but they have separate blockchain states and may be configured differently in various ways.

## Mainnet

The _mainnet_ is the official production network. It is considered the source of truth, and its tokens can be exchanged for "real world" money in various ways. As you might imagine, using the mainnet for development and testing is an expensive proposition."

## Setting up the testnet environment

We will do the following things.

- Add Goerli network to Metamask
- Get some fake ETH for the transaction
- Create a Goerli Network on Quick Node
- Update our hardhat.config.js file to include the Goerli network.

## Changing your network on MetaMask

We will not be using the live/production environment at the moment because it will be expensive to deploy a contract. You will need some real ETH to do that! And of course, learning and deploying contracts on production for the purpose of learning is not sustainable.

We will switch to Goerli Network, it is a test network which pretty much is a simulation of Ethereum blockchain production. Just open chrome and switch your network to Goerli, if you are not able to see it.

Here are the steps to turn on test networks

1.  Go to settings
2.  Open Advanced
3.  Scroll down to Show Test Networks
4.  Turn on

## Get some fake ETH $$

Try the following website and try to get some fake ETHs. This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. This is not real money, you can’t buy NFTs, or other assets via these ETH.

All you have to do is to drop your public address on the following links and the ETH will be transferred.

1.  [https://www.goerlifaucet.com/](https://www.goerlifaucet.com/)

## Get your private MetaMask key

Now let's get open our Metamask wallet and take out the private it. If you don't know how to use Metamask, first take this 5 mins guide on ⚡ [Setting up your Metamask wallet](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account).

Open the Metamask extension to find your private key. While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

Follow the image below to get your Private Key.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export private it and paste it somewhere secure.

🚨 DON'T COMMIT IT ON GITHUB, DONT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON'T SHARE IT ANYWHERE! IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!

## Creating Quick Node ⛓ endpoint

Now, we need to set up [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) with Ethereum testnet nodes, it’s gonna take like 5 mins.

QuickNode is a platform which helps you access the blockchain environment without going through the hassle of hosting your own node, saving time and resources. This platform lets you access blockchain nodes in a few clicks and you can scale the node performance according to your need thus creating an environment for you to scale your DApp.

- [Sign in / Sign up to your QuickNode account](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner)
- Click on create an QuickNode endpoint

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/16be74f40874b3818e99a9eafbd3bdc0943b512a7ab7374e732ce4522dc4787f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f667458384146622e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/16be74f40874b3818e99a9eafbd3bdc0943b512a7ab7374e732ce4522dc4787f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f667458384146622e706e67)

Now select Ethereum as Network and Goerli as chain and continue. We don’t need any add-on so click create endpoint now. Your endpoint HTTP address is important, save it somewhere for now, and we will use it in our project later.

## Getting Ready for Deployment

First let’s do some basic housekeeping stuff. We know that there are massive scams and security issues happening in the crypto world. You make a mistake and it can cost you a life time.

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. In order to avoid this issue. Let’s do the following.

`npm install dotenv --save touch .gitignore`

Now go ahead and create .env file at the base of your project. Open your .gitignore file and write .env there.

All the secrets and important keys related to your project will be stored in .env file and we can access this data whenever and wherever. In the gitignore file we simply write .env, it tells git to ignore that file from future commits.

Open the .env file you have just created. Add your Metamask Private Key and Alchemy App HTTP URL there. Should be something like this.

```
PRIVATE_KEY = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
API_URL_KEY = YOUR_QUICKNODE_APP_URL
```

We will update our hardhat config file to setup Goerli Deployment.

## Updating Hardhat Config file

Open your hardhat.config.js file and paste the following code.

```
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
require('dotenv').config(); //all the key value pairs are being made available due to this lib
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

const {API_URL_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY} = process.env; //environment variables are being loaded here.

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
  defaultNetwork: 'goerli',
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    goerli: {
        url: API_URL_KEY,
        accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  }
};
```

This code exports a configuration object for the Hardhat Ethereum development framework.

The dotenv library is being used to load environment variables from a .env file, which allows sensitive information such as private keys to be stored in a separate file that is ignored by version control.

The API_URL_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY environment variables are being restructured and assigned to constants.

The configuration object sets the Solidity version to be used as 0.8.17, sets the default network to Goerli, and defines network configurations for the hardhat and Goerli networks. The Goerli network configuration specifies the URL of the Ethereum client to connect to and the private keys of the accounts that will be available for use in transactions.

## Deployment

Now you are ready to deploy your contract to Goerli Network. Wohoo!! The command is almost same as before but now you will mention the goerli network where you are deploying your contract.

Let's run the command in our terminal and run this project.

`npx hardhat run scripts/run.js --network goerli`

Once your contract is deployed. You can do the following things.

- Copy your contract address and scan it on [Goerli Ethercan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/). The contract address must have appeared on terminal because of console log.
- Copy the public address of your Metamask wallet and check it on testnets.opensea.io.

Just like Etherscan, there is a [goerli.etherscan.io](https://goerli.etherscan.io/). This is to help you track your smart contracts and transaction. You can open Goerli testnet and copy paste your deployed contract to see if it is correctly deployed. Lemme show you what I am able to see.

There is an Opensea testnet as well. Here is the [link to that.](https://testnets.opensea.io/) You can checkout your minted NFT there as well. Just copy paste the address where you minted your NFT. We minted the NFT to your metamask wallet address. So just copy-paste that address in testnet Opensea and see if you can find your NFT. BOOOMMMM!!!! Here is mine.

And now, all I've got to say is well, well, well done! We have one ☝ last step left, which is, deploying the contract on Production Network, and that's coming up next.
