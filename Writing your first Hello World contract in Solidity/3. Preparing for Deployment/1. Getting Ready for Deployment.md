# Getting Ready for Deployment

Great work on creating your first Solidity contract. Now, get ready to do some needful task before deploying your contract.

## Get your private MetaMask key

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

1. Open the metamask extension to find your private key.
2. Click on Account.
3. Click on 3 dots on right side and go to “Account Details”.
4. Click on “Show private key”.
5. Enter Metamask password.
6. Copy your private key.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export the private key and paste it somewhere secure. DON'T COMMIT IT ON GITHUB, DON'T SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON'T SHARE IT ANYWHERE! IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!

## Setting up the environment variables

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. In order to avoid this issue. Let’s do the following.

```
npm install dotenv --save --force
```

Now go ahead and create `.env` file if you haven’t at the base of your project. Open your `.gitignore` file and write `.env` there.

All the secrets and important keys related to your project will be stored in .env file and we can access this data whenever and wherever. In the `gitignore` file we simply write `.env`, it tells git to ignore that file from future commits.

Open the `.env` file you have just created. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your MetaMask Private Key.

```
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

## **Updating Hardhat Config file**

Open your `hardhat.config.js` file and paste the following code.

```
require("dotenv").config();
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
const { PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.9",
  defaultNetwork: "sepolia",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    sepolia: {
      url: "https://sepolia.publicgoods.network",
      accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],
    },
  },
};
```

This will add the Sepolia Network to your HardHat project. It will help you deploy your contract exactly to the Sepolia Network you added in your MetaMask.

## That’s a wrap

In next lesson, we will dive straight into writing the deployment script and deploying the contract to the Sepolia Network.
