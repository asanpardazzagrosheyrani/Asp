# Writing the USDC Smart Contract

Welcome back again! Let’s get started right away to create our USDC smart contract. 

## USDC smart contract

Firstly, navigate to `sources/usdc.move` and start writing the following code:

First of all, we start with defining our contract and importing the essential packages that we will use in our code.

```
module dex::usdc {
  use std::option;

  use sui::url;
  use sui::transfer;
  use sui::coin;
  use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
```

Next, we will define the struct named `USDC`. It is a one-time witness to create a Current. It has the drop ability so it cannot be transferred or stored.

```jsx
struct USDC has drop {}
```

Then, we create an `init` function that runs once on module creation and accepts a one-time `witness` as the first argument. 

We have created a `witness` struct with 1 ability, `drop`, it guarantees that there is only one in the entire network as you can only get it in the `init` function.

Inside the `init` function, we call the `create_currency`. Creating a currency requires a one-time `witness` to ensure it is a unique coin and only the holder of the `TreasuryCap` is allowed to mint and burn this coin.

```jsx
fun init(witness: USDC, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
      let (treasury_cap, metadata) = coin::create_currency<USDC>(
            witness, // One time witness
            9, // Decimals of the coin
            b"USDC", // Symbol of the coin
            b"USDC Coin", // Name of the coin
            b"A stable coin issued by Circle", // Description of the coin
            option::some(url::new_unsafe_from_bytes(b"https://s3.coinmarketcap.com/static-gravity/image/5a8229787b5e4c809b5914eef709b59a.png")), // An image of the Coin
            ctx
        );

      // We send the treasury capability to the deployer
      transfer::public_transfer(treasury_cap, tx_context::sender(ctx));
      // Objects defined in different modules need to use the public_ transfer functions
      transfer::public_share_object(metadata);
  }
```

Lastly, we are adding the test that we will implement in upcoming lessons. This test will help us verify the code and check if it is working fine

```
// ** Test Functions

  #[test_only]
  public fun init_for_testing(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    init(USDC {}, ctx);
  }
}
```

## Complete code

Here’s the complete code for your ease.

```
module dex::usdc {
  use std::option;

  use sui::url;
  use sui::transfer;
  use sui::coin;
  use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

  // ** Structs

  // One Time Witness to create a Current in Sui
  // This struct has the drop ability so it cannot be transferred nor stored. 
  // It allows the Network to know it is a unique type

  struct USDC has drop {}

  // The init function runs once on Module creation and accepts a one-time witness as the first argument
  // Witness is a struct with 1 ability, drop, it guarantees that there is only one in the entire network as you can only get it in the init function
  
fun init(witness: USDC, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
      // We call the create_currency
      // Creating a currency requires a one-time witness to ensure it is a unique coin
      // Only the holder of the TreasuryCap is allowed to mint and burn this coin
      // Metadata holds all the information about the coin, so other applications query it
      
			let (treasury_cap, metadata) = coin::create_currency<USDC>(
            witness, // One time witness
            9, // Decimals of the coin
            b"USDC", // Symbol of the coin
            b"USDC Coin", // Name of the coin
            b"A stable coin issued by Circle", // Description of the coin
            option::some(url::new_unsafe_from_bytes(b"https://s3.coinmarketcap.com/static-gravity/image/5a8229787b5e4c809b5914eef709b59a.png")), // An image of the Coin
            ctx
        );

      // We send the treasury capability to the deployer

      transfer::public_transfer(treasury_cap, tx_context::sender(ctx));

      // Objects defined in different modules need to use the public_ transfer functions
      
			transfer::public_share_object(metadata);
  }

  // ** Test Functions

  #[test_only]
  public fun init_for_testing(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    init(USDC {}, ctx);
  }
}
```

## That’s a wrap

USDC contract will help us create and fill our balance with USDC coins. So that we can easily convert USDC coins to ETH or ETH to USDC coins. Next, we will implement the Dex smart contract that will help us swap the ETH and USDC coins and keep a record of the balances of our tokens.
