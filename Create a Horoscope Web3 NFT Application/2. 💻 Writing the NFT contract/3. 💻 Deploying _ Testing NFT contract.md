# üíª Writing the NFT contract
## üíª Deploying & Testing NFT contract

As NFTschool, describes it.

"There are three environments for a blockchain network: mainnet, devnet, and testnet.

### devnet
Till now we were using the local development network to run our smart contracts. This is the easiest and fastest way to get started, iterate and run things without having to setup tons of stuff. For setting up devnet, we used Hardhat that provided us a local ethereum like blockchain environment. Remember at the start of this project, I mentioned, how every time we deploy a smart contract it is a start from scratch. Now we are being promoted. Since we have setup a basic contract which we believe can run. We will use a testnet environment.

### testnet
Because devnets are a simplified simulation of the real network, they don‚Äôt always behave in quite the same way. This is a good thing when you want fast development cycles, but not so great when you want to know how your contract will actually work on mainnet.

For that, you can deploy and run your contract on a test network, or  _testnet_. These networks generally run the same code as the mainnet, but they have separate blockchain states and may be configured differently in various ways.

### mainnet
The  _mainnet_  is the official production network. It is considered the source of truth, and its tokens can be exchanged for ‚Äúreal world‚Äù money in various ways. As you might imagine, using the mainnet for development and testing is an expensive proposition."

### Setting up the testnet environment
We will do the following things.
-   Add Goerli network to Metamask
-   Get some fake ETH for the transaction
-   Create a Ethereum Goerli Network app on Alchemy
-   Update our hardhat.config.js file to include the goerli network.

#### Changing your network on MetaMask
We will not be using the live/production environment at the moment because it will be expensive to deploy a contract. You will need some real ETH to do that! And of course, learning and deploying contracts on production for the purpose of learning is not sustainable.

We will switch to Goerli Network, it is a test network which pretty much is a simulation of ethereum blockchain production. Just open chrome and switch your network to Goerli, if you are not able to see it.

Here are the steps to turn on test networks

1.  Go to Settings
2.  Open Advanced
3.  Scroll down to Show Test Networks
4.  Turn on

### Get some fake ETH $$ ü§ë

Try the following website and try to get some fake ETHs. This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. This is not real money, you can‚Äôt buy NFTs, or other assets via these ETH.

All you have to do is to drop your public address on the following links and the ETH will be transferred.

1.  [https://www.goerlifaucet.com/](https://www.goerlifaucet.com/)

### Get your private ü¶ä MetaMask key

Open the Metamask extension to find your private key. While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export private it and paste it somewhere secure. DON‚ÄôT COMMIT IT ON GITHUB, DONT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON‚ÄôT SHARE IT ANYWHERE! IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!

### Creating Quick Node ‚õì endpoint

Now, we need to set up  [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner)  with Ethereum testnet nodes, it‚Äôs gonna take like 5 mins.

QuickNode is a platform which helps you access the blockchain environment without going through the hassle of hosting your own node, saving time and resources. This platform lets you access blockchain nodes in a few clicks and you can scale the node performance according to your need thus creating an environment for you to scale your DApp.

-   Sign in / Sign up to your [**QuickNode**](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner)  account
-   Click on create an [**QuickNode**](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner)  endpoint

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nusZ81aRnb8ue5J6qJLN29NG-lQRe-oQcxoeHyplNrA2IpLKg3cBC2tXPE0XXg2JEI1ugLuCX-fSNFYdtJIctMYW9hLWo7jsQxun7aQU6w_0w1Hqb3Md6lMf1Q9bM57zAm0xKmNDzqCNghdNwYHetosBTnWTnmgCLKUarXGyuUs-EHxBKdN33yEVChkU-HQCo0RUCw)

-   Now select Ethereum as Network and Goerli as chain and continue
-   We don‚Äôt need any add-on so click **create endpoint**  now

Now once you create the endpoint you can start setting up our Metamask Wallet with QuickNode. Now let‚Äôs move to the next part! Hope this was really easy for you to understand!

-   Go to your Metamask wallet and click on the list of networks.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2UexuPf9TiOmgJskf1KjXbksBlQwnTvRS0tU_nzrKg_3wc4hzVAX4SDqifH3y8YyTb2YJIb2NVQEF_ShIkATyplBcz5_zrzxWuKkodQs5h2JJhUWuo4I0kIRECG1evY510WYAJlbc6W9DyTBVb3gCn9KYAi8ECYR_4tMGer7RBrxErQ8-PpNpOYCrNYj6FrRWD5LrQ)

-   A drop-down list will show up with a list of networks but you need to click on **ADD NETWORK**  at the bottom of the list
-   Now you will have a form to fill up to add a new network to your metamask account
-   Let‚Äôs go back to QuickNode Endpoint Dashboard, and copy the HTTPS

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rVD2taxs_lfShmW29I27PatQTIx9NZLnBIA3nGnyKye4Q2WQM_tiC8XpeWHCxu5g6irMWCZm6TnD3LqFhrcmwCFIWXAlnqrPoTmBB8XSiaDerKm7PvbNy625amuVm-vutlS8uyb8A1V0RxEdmtDEKDRaq_4X70LClb42guWZVyX-XCrm7htvkcFPwDAPDJMN2acgbg)

Now let‚Äôs go back to the Metamask add network form and

-   Paste the HTTPS in **New RPC Url**  field with 5 as **Chain ID**,
-   ‚ÄúETH‚Äù as **Currency Symbol**,
-   Ethereum Goerli as **Network Name (Any name as you like)**  and
-   Finally [https://goerli.etherscan.io/](https://goerli.etherscan.io/%20)  as **Block Explorer URL.**
-   Click Save

-   So, we have finished setting up metamask for our token, now let‚Äôs get some free ETH tokens to pay for the transaction fees.
