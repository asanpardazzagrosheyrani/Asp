# ðŸ’¡Create Your First Flow Token - II

Hey there, rockstar learner! In our last lesson, we covered the basics of the awesome `FungibleToken` interface. Now, get ready to level up and explore even more!

In this thrilling lesson, we're diving deeper into the world of `FungibleToken`. Hold on tight as we learn how to implement the Vault resource. It's like building your very own treasure chest to store those precious tokens!

## ðŸ’¡Implementing the `Vault` resource

Letâ€™s look at the implementation of `Vault` resource.

```
// Declaring a new resource called Vault which
// implements the interfaces Provider, Receiver, and Balance.
pub resource Vault: Provider, Receiver, Balance {

		// The variable used to keep track of the amount of funds held in the Vault.
    pub var balance: UFix64

		// This is the constructor for the Vault resource
    init(balance: UFix64)

    pub fun withdraw(amount: UFix64): @Vault {
        pre {
            self.balance >= amount:
                "Amount withdrawn must be less than or equal than the balance of the Vault"
        }
        post {
            self.balance == before(self.balance) - amount:
                "New Vault balance must be the difference of the previous balance and the withdrawn Vault"
        }
    }

    pub fun deposit(from: @Vault) {
        pre {
            from.isInstance(self.getType()):
                "Cannot deposit an incompatible token type"
        }
        post {
            self.balance == before(self.balance) + before(from.balance):
                "New Vault balance must be the sum of the previous balance and the deposited Vault"
        }
    }
}
```

Letâ€™s go through `pub resource Vault: Provider, Receiver, Balance` the code.

```
pub fun withdraw(amount: UFix64): @Vault
```

- This function allows a user to withdraw funds from the Vault.
- The function takes an amount parameter and returns a reference to the Vault resource.

```
pre {
    self.balance >= amount:
        "Amount withdrawn must be less than or equal than the balance of the Vault"
}
```

- This is a precondition which checks that the balance of the `Vault` is greater than or equal to the amount being withdrawn.
- The precondition checks that the current balance of the `Vault` is greater than or equal to the amount being withdrawn. If the precondition is false, an error message will be thrown.

```
post {
    self.balance == before(self.balance) - amount:
        "New Vault balance must be the difference of the previous balance and the withdrawn Vault"
}
```

- This is a post-condition which checks that the balance of the `Vault` after the withdrawal is equal to the balance before the withdrawal minus the amount withdrawn.
- The postcondition checks that the new balance of the `Vault` is equal to the previous balance minus the amount withdrawn.
- If the postcondition is false, an error message will be thrown.

```
pub fun deposit(from: @Vault)
```

- This function allows a user to deposit funds into the `Vault`.
- The function takes a reference to another Vault resource as a parameter.
- The function does not return anything.

```
pre {
    from.isInstance(self.getType()):
        "Cannot deposit an incompatible token type"
}
```

- This line specifies a precondition for the `deposit` function using the `pre` keyword.
- This is a precondition which checks that the type of the `Vault` being deposited matches the type of the current `Vault`.
- If the precondition is false, an error message will be thrown.

```
post {
    self.balance == before(self.balance) + before(from.balance):
        "New Vault balance must be the sum of the previous balance and the deposited Vault"
}
```

- This line specifies a postcondition for the `deposit` function using the `post` keyword.
- This is a postcondition which checks that the balance of the `Vault` after the deposit is equal to the balance before the deposit plus the balance of the deposited `Vault`.
- If the postcondition is false, an error message will be thrown.

### `Vault` code block summary

This code introduces a resource called Vault that is super powerful! It implements three cool interfaces: Provider, Receiver, and Balance. It's like a Swiss Army knife of functionalities!

When a Vault resource is created, it's initialized with a specific balance amount. It's like setting the starting point for your digital wealth! ðŸ’°

Now, here's where it gets interesting: the Vault resource offers two functions: withdraw and deposit. The withdraw function lets a user take out a specific amount from the vault, but only if the vault's balance is equal to or greater than the amount being withdrawn. It's like having a security check to ensure you're not going overboard!

On the other hand, the deposit function allows a user to add another compatible Vault resource into the current vault, but only if it's the same type. It's like merging two powerful vaults into one!

After every deposit or withdrawal, the new balance of the vault is checked to make sure it matches the expected balance. It's like having a double-check to ensure everything is in order!

So, with this code, you have the ability to manage your vault, withdraw funds securely, deposit compatible resources, and maintain the perfect balance. It's all about taking control of your digital riches and making sure everything is working smoothly! Let's unlock the full potential of this Vault resource! ðŸ’ª

## Implementing Empty Vault

Letâ€™s look at the implementation of Empty Vault.

```
// This is a public function named createEmptyVault()
// that returns a reference to a newly created Vault instance.
pub fun createEmptyVault(): @Vault {
    post {
        result.balance == 0.0: "The newly created Vault must have zero balance"
    }
}
```

Letâ€™s go through `createEmptyVault(): @Vault` the code.

```
post {
    result.balance == 0.0: "The newly created Vault must have zero balance"
}
```

- This is a postcondition that verifies that the `Vault` instance created by `createEmptyVault()` has a zero balance.
- `result.balance == 0.0` is the condition being checked in the postcondition.
- It verifies that the `balance` property of the `Vault` instance returned by `createEmptyVault()` is equal to zero.
- `"The newly created Vault must have zero balance"` is an error message that will be displayed if the postcondition fails. It explains what went wrong and how to fix it.

## Complete Fungible Token code

Letâ€™s look at the complete code of the Flow Fungible Token.

```
// A Fungible Token contract interface definition
pub contract interface FungibleToken {

		// The total supply of the fungible token
    pub var totalSupply: UFix64

		// Event triggered when the tokens are initialized
    pub event TokensInitialized(initialSupply: UFix64)

		// Event triggered when tokens are withdrawn from a vault
    pub event TokensWithdrawn(amount: UFix64, from: Address?)

		// Event triggered when tokens are deposited into a vault
    pub event TokensDeposited(amount: UFix64, to: Address?)

    // Resource interface for withdrawing tokens from a vault
    pub resource interface Provider {

        // Withdraw tokens from a vault and return a reference to the withdrawn vault
        pub fun withdraw(amount: UFix64): @Vault {
            post {
                result.balance == amount:
                    "Withdrawal amount must be the same as the balance of the withdrawn Vault"
            }
        }
    }

    // Resource interface for depositing tokens into a vault
    pub resource interface Receiver {

        // Deposit tokens into a vault
        pub fun deposit(from: @Vault)

        // Get the types of vaults supported by this contract
        pub fun getSupportedVaultTypes(): {Type: Bool} {
            if self.getType().isSubtype(of: Type<@FungibleToken.Vault>()) {
                return {self.getType(): true}
            } else {
                return {}
            }
        }
    }

    // Resource interface for keeping track of the balance of a vault
    pub resource interface Balance {

				// The current balance of the vault
        pub var balance: UFix64

        // Initialize the balance of a new vault
        init(balance: UFix64) {
            post {
                self.balance == balance:
                    "Balance must be initialized to the initial balance"
            }
        }

        // Get the views available for this resource
        pub fun getViews(): [Type] {
            return []
        }

        // Resolve a view of this resource
        pub fun resolveView(_ view: Type): AnyStruct? {
            return nil
        }
    }

    // Resource definition for a fungible token vault
    pub resource Vault: Provider, Receiver, Balance {

				// The current balance of the vault
        pub var balance: UFix64

        // Initialize the balance of a new vault
        init(balance: UFix64)

        // Withdraw tokens from the vault and return a reference to the withdrawn vault
        pub fun withdraw(amount: UFix64): @Vault {
            pre {
                self.balance >= amount:
                    "Amount withdrawn must be less than or equal than the balance of the Vault"
            }
            post {
                self.balance == before(self.balance) - amount:
                    "New Vault balance must be the difference of the previous balance and the withdrawn Vault"
            }
        }

        // Deposit tokens into the vault
        pub fun deposit(from: @Vault) {
            pre {
                from.isInstance(self.getType()):
                    "Cannot deposit an incompatible token type"
            }
            post {
                self.balance == before(self.balance) + before(from.balance):
                    "New Vault balance must be the sum of the previous balance and the deposited Vault"
            }
        }
    }

    // Create a new empty vault
    pub fun createEmptyVault(): @Vault {
        post {
            result.balance == 0.0: "The newly created Vault must have zero balance"
        }
    }
}
```
