# 🎟️ Let’s Talk About Fungible Token Standard

Hey there! In the last lesson, we talked about tokens and Flow Token Standards. Now get ready for the next level! In this lesson, we're going to learn about Fungible Tokens – what they are, how they work, and specifically how they work in Cadence. Get excited, because this is where things start to get really interesting!

## Flow ecosystem

In the Flow community, we use Flow Fungible Tokens for digital currencies, rewards, and loyalty points. They make it super simple for people to transfer and exchange with each other. Plus, they're a breeze for developers to use when building token-based systems on the Flow blockchain. So let's get ready to explore all the exciting possibilities of Flow Fungible Tokens!

## The Flow Fungible Token Standard

The Flow Fungible Token Standard consist of a contract interface called `FungibleToken` . The `FungibleToken` standard requires contracts to define a `Vault` resource that represents an account's owned tokens. Each account that has tokens has a corresponding `Vault` stored in its account storage. To send or receive tokens, users call functions on each other's Vaults.

Now, let’s explore this one-by-one in detail, learn how each part of the standard works and explore the basic coding structure of the Fungible Token Standard.

### `FungibleToken` contract interface

The FungibleToken contract interface is a set of rules that all Fungible Token contracts must follow. When someone wants to create a new token contract, their contract must implement this interface. It ensures that the contract adheres to the specified rules and naming conventions, making token contracts work consistently and predictably.

In a nutshell, the FungibleToken interface acts as a guidebook for token contracts, ensuring they play by the rules. By implementing the interface, the contract agrees to follow the defined standards, allowing for seamless compatibility among different token contracts.

Let’s look at how you can declare the `FungibleToken` contract interface in Cadence.

```
pub contract interface FungibleToken {

	// The FungibleToken hold following functionalities:
	// Resources
	//  Resource Interfaces
	// Field Requirements
	// Functions

}
```

### `Vault` resource

So, if you have tokens, you'll need a special thing called a Vault resource. Every account that owns tokens should have one stored in their account storage. It's like having a safe place to keep your tokens secure!

The cool thing about the Vault resource is that it has methods that you and others can use to interact with your token balance. It's like having a set of tools to manage and do stuff with your tokens!

Inside the Vault resource, your token balance is stored as a fixed-point number, which is just a fancy way of representing numbers. It uses the `UFix64` type, which is like a specific format for keeping track of your token balance.

Here's a basic example of what a `Vault` resource might look like in Cadence:

```
// Defining the Vault resource interface
pub resource Vault {

    // The balance is represented as a fixed-point number using UFix64 type
    pub var balance: UFix64

    // Defining the withdraw function to withdraw tokens from the Vault
    pub fun withdraw(amount: UFix64): @Vault

    // Defining the deposit function to deposit tokens into the Vault
    pub fun deposit(vault: @Vault): @Vault
}
```

### `Provider`, `Receiver`, and `Balance` resource interfaces

We have three cool resource interfaces: the `Provider`, `Receiver`, and `Balance`. These interfaces set some rules for the functions in the Vault. They have pre-conditions and post-conditions that control how these functions can be executed. It's like having some guidelines to follow when using the Vault!

The reason these interfaces are separate is pretty neat! It's because they allow users to share their `Vault` reference in a specific way. They can choose to expose only certain fields and functions by implementing one or more of these interfaces. It's like having different levels of access for different users.

Not only that, but these interfaces also give users the flexibility to create their own custom resources. They can make something cool and unique by implementing these interfaces. For example, if someone wants to create a faucet, they can conform to the `Provider` interface. It's like having the power to create different functionalities with tokens!

Here's a basic example of what these interfaces might look like in Cadence:

```
// Defining the Provider resource interface
pub resource interface Provider {
    // Defining the provideTokens function to provide tokens to the recipient
    pub fun provideTokens(recipient: @Receiver, amount: UFix64)
}

// Defining the Receiver resource interface
pub resource interface Receiver {
    // Defining the receiveTokens function to receive tokens from the provider
    pub fun receiveTokens(provider: @Provider, amount: UFix64)
}

// Defining the Balance resource interface
pub resource interface Balance {
    // Define the getBalance function to get the balance of the specified account
    pub fun getBalance(account: Address): UFix64
}
```

> **Don’t Worry!** We will look at the practical example of Flow Fungible Token Standard in detail in the next lesson.

## Wrap up

You can send and receive tokens using resources and interfaces in Fungible Token contracts. It's all about making peer-to-peer transactions super easy and without any need for a central ledger smart contract.

To send tokens to another user, it's as simple as two steps! First, you'll withdraw the tokens from your Vault. It's like taking them out of your personal safe. Then, you'll call the deposit function on the other user's Vault. It's like handing over the tokens to their safe. And ta-da! The transfer is complete!

By using this process, you can send tokens directly to another user without any intermediaries. It's like having a direct connection to transfer tokens securely and efficiently. No hassle, no central authority involved!

So, it's all about withdrawing from your Vault and depositing into the other user's Vault to make seamless peer-to-peer token transfers. Easy peasy!

Get ready for an exciting adventure! 🚀 In the next part, we'll dive into creating your own Flow fungible token using the standards we covered. It's time to unleash your creativity and leave your mark in the digital world. So gear up and get ready to embark on this thrilling journey! Let's make your very own token and make things awesome!
