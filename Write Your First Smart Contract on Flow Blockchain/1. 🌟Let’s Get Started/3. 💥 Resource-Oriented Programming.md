# 💥 Resource-Oriented Programming

Hey there, welcome back! In the last lesson, we talked about the basics of Flow Blockchain and why it's so cool.

Now, in this lesson, we're gonna dive deeper into one of the most important parts (pillar) of Flow Blockchain: something called "resource-oriented programming." This is a key feature that sets Flow apart from other blockchains and helps it solve problems that other blockchains struggle with.

Before starting with the resource-oriented programming, let’s go through object-oriented programming that you are already familiar with. It will help you differentiate and learn faster. Let's go! 💪

## 🤖 Object-oriented programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is all about organizing your code. Basically, with OOP, you create little "objects" that represent real-world things. These objects have properties (like color, size, etc.) and behaviors (like what they can do). And you can create different types of objects that share common characteristics.

## 🤖 Resource-oriented programming

With Resource-Oriented Programming (ROP), you create your code around the resources that your program needs to interact with. These resources could be things like files, databases, or even web pages. By organizing your code this way, you can make sure your program runs smoothly and efficiently.

A resource is something important in your program that you need to manage and work with, like data or a service. It's like a unique identifier that helps you access and work with it easily.

Let's talk about resources and objects using a simple example.

## 🤖 Understand difference between object and resource using real-world example

To understand the difference between resources and objects, let's use a library as an example. In a library, books can be both resources and objects.

### 🛠️ Object

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object represents a specific instance of a class. In the context of our library example, an object could be a particular book like "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." Objects have both data, like the author and publication year, and behavior, like borrowing and returning.

### 🛠️ Resource

However, in Resource-Oriented Programming (ROP), we focus on resources and their representation and manipulation. In our library example, the entire collection of books is the resource, while each individual book is an object within that resource.

To interact with the resource (the collection of books), we use operations like retrieving, adding, updating, or removing books. In ROP, resources are typically accessed and manipulated using unique identifiers like a URL.

## 🤖 ROP in Flow Blockchain

Okay, so when we talk about Flow, there are a few important parts to it. One of these parts is ROP, which actually defines how code should be structured in Flow and it helps represent digital ownership of assets on Flow.

To use ROP in the Flow blockchain, people use a special language called Cadence. In Cadence programming language, ROP works by creating objects that represent the resources we're working with.

### 🛠️ Resource example

For example, if we're working with a file in Cadence, we can create an object that represents that file and has methods for reading or writing to it. This makes it easier for us to work with the file in our code.

### 🛠️ Real-world example

For example, let's say we're building a web application in Cadence. We might have resources like web pages, APIs, and databases that we need to work with. By using ROP, we can create objects that represent each of these resources, and then use those objects to interact with them in our code. This makes it easier for us to build a scalable and maintainable web application that can handle lots of users and complex interactions.

## Wrap up

Awesome, you've got a good handle on the Flow blockchain and how it works! But there's so much more to explore, and we can't wait to dive into the next exciting topic: the Cadence programming language. 🙌

In the next lesson, you'll be learning all about how to use Cadence to write amazing code for the blockchain. Get ready for a deep dive into the world of programming and all the cool things you can do with it!
