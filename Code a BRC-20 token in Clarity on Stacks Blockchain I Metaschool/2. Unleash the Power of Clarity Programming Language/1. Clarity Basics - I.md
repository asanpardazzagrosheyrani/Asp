# Clarity Basics - I

Welcome back!  Remember what we talked about in the last lesson? We learned about Clarity and how it works. Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to dive into the fun part - basics of Clarity! Are you excited? Let's get started! 

Before starting, there’s something unique about clarity and that is we use brackets **()** to define our statements. So let’s continue our learning journey!

## Data Types

Clarity supports several data types that are commonly used in programming languages, including:

- `int`: Represents integer numbers, such as `42` or `123`.
- `uint`: Represents unsigned integers, such as `10` or `1000`.
- `bool`: Represents boolean values, which can be either `true` or `false`.
- `principal`: Represents a blockchain address, which is a unique identifier for an account or contract.
- `buff`: Represents a buffer, which is a sequence of bytes used for storing data.
- `list`: Represents a list, which is an ordered collection of items of the same data type.
- `tuple`: Represents a tuple, which is an ordered collection of items of different data types.

Clarity also supports type aliases, which allow developers to create custom names for existing data types. This can be useful for improving the readability and maintainability of code. An example of this could be:

```
;; We define a type alias Username that represents a string.
;; We can then use this alias throughout our code, 
;; making it easier to understand the purpose and intent of the data.
(type-alias Username string)

;; The validate-username function takes a Username parameter 
;; and validates whether it's a valid username or not. 

(define-public (validate-username (username Username))
  (if (is-valid-username? username)
    (ok)  ;; If the username is valid, it returns an "ok" result.   
    ;; Otherwise, it returns an "err" result with a message that shows invalidity.
		(err "Invalid username")))

;; this function is a helper function that contains the 
;; actual logic for validating a username. 
;; It takes a Username parameter and performs the necessary 
;; checks to determine its validity.
(define-public (is-valid-username? (username Username))
  ; Implementation of username validation logic goes here
  ; (e.g., checking length, character restrictions, etc.)
)
```

Overall, Clarity's data types provide a way to represent and manipulate various types of data within a smart contract, enabling developers to implement complex logic and functionality.

## Variables

In Clarity, there are two types of variables: Local and State.

1. **Local** variables are declared inside functions and are temporary, existing only within the function's scope. They are not stored on the blockchain.
2. **State** variables are declared outside functions and maintain the state of the smart contract. They are accessible from anywhere in the contract and are stored on the blockchain for long-term use.

### Syntax

We can declare a state variable as:

</center>



- `define-data-var` : keyword used to define the variable
- `var-name` : name of the variable
- `var-type` : type of the variable that is defined
- `initial-value` : value of the variable

You can **set** value of the variable by:

```
(var-set my-variable 5000)
```

You can **get** value of the variable by:

```
(var-get my-variable)
```

You can **print** value of the variable by:

```
(print (var-set my-variable 5000))
```

You can add **comment** by adding anything after `;;`. 

Another cool aspect of Clarity is that it also supports type inference, which means that the data type of a variable can be automatically determined based on its initial value. For example, if you assign the value `true` to a variable, Clarity will automatically infer that the variable is of type boolean.

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned about the basics of Clarity. We talked about data types, including integer, boolean, and blockchain address, and how they are used in Clarity. We also discussed the two types of variables in Clarity, local and state, and how they are declared and used. Additionally, we covered type inference and how it makes writing code easier. 

Next, we will cover more about Clarity basics so stay tuned for the next lesson!
