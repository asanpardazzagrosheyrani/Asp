# Deploy the dApp

Kudos to you for making it so far! Now we will finally deploy our dApp on the Fuel blockchain. Yayyy!!

Open a new terminal in your `petition-contract` directory or continue using the previous terminal if opened. 

Run the following command to build your files:

```
forc build
```

This will generate the following output:

Now let’s deploy the dApp using the following command:

```
forc deploy --testnet
```

This command will ask for the password you set and then will successfully deploy your files.

## That’s a wrap

In conclusion, we learned how to deploy a dApp on the Fuel blockchain. We built our files using `forc build` and deployed the dApp using `forc deploy --testnet`. Now, let's add the frontend to our dApp.
