# Setting Up Frontend

Kudos! We have deployed our dApp and now we are all set to proceed in setting up our frontend. No more waiting, let’s go!

## Set up the frontend

Open a new terminal in your `petition-contract` directory or continue using the previous terminal if opened. 

Run the following command to clone the frontend directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/fuel-petition-frontend-boilerplate.git
```

After clonning the app don’t forget to move to the specific folder in your terminal.

```
cd fuel-petition-frontend-boilerplate
```

Let’s install our dependencies. Run each command one by one.

```

npm install
npm install fuels@0.60.0 @fuel-wallet/sdk@0.13.0 --save
```

## Set up the ABIs

Time to move our ABI JSON files to the front end.

1. Copy your `petition-contract` path and replace [PETITION_PATH] with it.
2. Copy your `frontend` path and replace [FRONTEND_PATH] with it.

```
npx fuels typegen -i [PETITION_PATH]/out/debug/*-abi.json -o [FRONTEND_PATH]/src/contracts
```

**Note:** Please make sure to copy the complete paths of each folder from the Visual Studio code. Relative path won’t work here. Here’s what my complete command looks like.

```
npx fuels typegen -i /Users/username/Desktop/metaschool/fuel/petition-testing/petition-contract/out/debug/*-abi.json -o /Users/username/Desktop/metaschool/fuel/petition-testing/fuel-petition-frontend-boilerplate/src/contracts
```

This will add the `contracts` folder to your `src`:

## Set up contract address

Move to the `src/App.tsx` file in the `fuel-petition-frontend-boilerplate` folder and replace the your fuel contract address in the following line.

```
const CONTRACT_ID = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; //Replace with your contract address
```

## Run the frontend

Now run the following command to start your app:

```
npm start
```

You will see an output like this:

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, we learned how to set up the front end for our dApp. We cloned the frontend directory, installed dependencies, and moved the ABI JSON files. Congratulations on completing this lesson and setting up your dApp's front end! Happy coding!

In the next lesson, we will interact with our dApp.
