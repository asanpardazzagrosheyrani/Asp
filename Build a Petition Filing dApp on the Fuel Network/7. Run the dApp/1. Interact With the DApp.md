# Interact with the DApp

Now that you have deployed the contract and completed running the front end as well. In this lesson, we will learn how can you interact with the front end and use the petition dApp.

## Start interacting with the dApp

We will walk you through each feature of the dApp and how you can interact with it. So, buckle up and follow the steps one by one.

1. **Connect your wallet:** Make sure that the Fuel wallet is set up in your system and already has some tokens. Then click on the “Connect Wallet” button. Remember to select the "Fuel Wallet" from the list of wallets.

2. **Create a campaign:** First of all, we will create a create campaign. Fill in the first field, set the number of deadlines, and click on “Create Campaign.” After creating the campaign remember to save the campaign ID somewhere. You’ll need the campaign ID to sign the petition, get information, or end it.
