# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone🌈, I am Fareeha and I’m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Celo for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own ERC20 token in Solidity programming language and then deploying it on Celo blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of coding in Celo using Solidity.

Let’s look at how you will be interacting with the token by the end of the course.

Why Celo? Celo is the PoS Layer-1 protocol that supports developing dApps and helps to build a carbon-negative financial system. Celo achieves being carbon-negative through a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, carbon offsetting, incentivizing regenerative behavior, and introducing natural capital-backed currencies. These measures aim to reduce resource usage, offset negative impacts, and encourage environmental renewal, building a system that sustains and renews environmental resources.

A few of the early supporters of Celo are coinbase, Polychain Capital, Linda Xie, and many more.

Not only this, Celo has 1,000+ mission-aligned projects, 256,268,759 total transactions and 22,191,140 unique wallets as of June, 2023.

## Course overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Celo blockchain
2. Learn to write ERC20 token in Solidity programming language
3. Set up MetaMask for Celo
4. Deploy the Solidity smart contract to Celo blockchain

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about Celo blockchain and how they can deploy the smart contracts on it. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), and Solidity Programming language because in this course we will focus more on writing ERC20 token and deploying it on Celo blockchain.

- If you want to learn Solidity programming language in detail, you can refer to our course [10 days of Solidity](https://metaschool.so/courses/10-days-of-solidity).

## Prerequisites

- Metamask extension installed in your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))

> **Note:** Please refer to [this course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) to setup your MetaMask if you still hasn’t. Come back to this course after you have set it up.

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
