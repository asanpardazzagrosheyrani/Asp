Course Learnings & Prerequisites
--------------------------------

Before we get started, it's important you familiarize yourself with all that we'll be learning. 

### **This course on how to launch your own cryptocurrency on Solana will cover 👇🏼**

*   How to create SPL Token
*   Using Solana CLI
*   Deployment on Solana Devnet

### **Prerequisites to build a token on Solana Network**

This is the most important part because the CLI we will be using to create this token has a lot of dependencies and we have to make sure that we set the environment for Solana to run perfectly!

Moving on, we will be using cargo to create the token. Cargo is the NPM or Yarn version of Rust, so we'll need to install Rust and set up its dependencies correctly. Lastly, install the Solana Tool Suite to create our token which also depends on Rust. 

A multi-paradigm, all-purpose programming language is called Rust. Performance, type safety, and concurrency are highlighted in Rust. Unlike other memory-safe languages, Rust maintains memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without necessitating the employment of a garbage collector or reference counting.

You can learn more about rust on [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)  
  
**Why we need rust?**  
In essence, Solidity was developed to enable the creation of Smart Contracts for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. That is, Solidity is used for Ethereum smart contracts and all other blockchains that leverage Ethereum as a Layer 1 solution. You can send tokens to a wallet using that way because Solidity has been best suited for handling smart contract transactions in Ethereum-based blockchains with modifiers like payable. Additionally, Solidity is so user- and developer-friendly that it enables you to create straightforward smart contracts in a matter of minutes.

But in Solana, Rust is the preferred language for creating smart contracts. Rust's ability to produce extremely efficient apps with total control over memory and cache management, trash collection, etc. is the key justification for using it.

As a result, it makes it possible for dApps created using Rust to be extremely efficient and use far less gas than dApps created with Solidity, and consequently, Ethereum.

So, install these:

*   [Solana Tool Suite](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
