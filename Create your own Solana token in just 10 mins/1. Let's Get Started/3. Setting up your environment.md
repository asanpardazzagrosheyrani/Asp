# Setting Up Your Environment

Let's start setting up the developement enviroment for our course.

## First we need to install Rust,

- Go to [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)
- Download the setup or curl it according to your requirement
- Open the setup and follow the on-screen instruction and install the setup

## Then we need to install Solana Tool Suite,

- Go to [https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- Follow the instruction and install according to your platform

ðŸ§µNote: When Installing Rust, make sure you follow the CLI instructions and install VS code. After installing VS code also install the C++ development build tool for VS code.

Once you have installed both the dependencies, letâ€™s check if we installed it correctly or not!

Open your CLI and runÂ **cargo - - version** and you will get a output like this if you have installed rust correctly

then runÂ **solana.exe**Â **\- -version** and you will get a output like this if you have installed the Solana tool suite correctly
