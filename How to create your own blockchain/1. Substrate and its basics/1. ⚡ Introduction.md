Substrate and its basics
========================

‚ö° Introduction
--------------------
Hey fam,

Today we are going to launch a blockchain using Substrate. It's going to be so much fun because not many platforms (or any) have attempted to teach how to launch a blockchain.¬†

But but but‚Ä¶ will not only be building a blockchain, rather we'll simultaneously dive deep into blockchain concepts as well. ¬†

We cannot put more emphasis on how important this course is for your career as a web3 engineer, so study and study closely.¬†

### So, what is Substrate?

It's the main blockchain SDK (software development kit) used by programmers to build the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.

Polkadot is a Layer-0 protocol, built by Ethereum‚Äôs co-founder Gavin Wood citing Ethereum‚Äôs inability to scale. Wood wanted to solve this problem by introducing a proof-of-stake (POS) validation system since PoS consensus is used by most modern blockchains.

Polkadot makes the development of a Layer-1 blockchain easier by providing a built-in infrastructure for developers to build upon.

Now let‚Äôs understand,

#### Why do we need Substrate?

Blockchain development is a very complex and resource consuming task. It involves many sophisticated technologies including advanced cryptography and distributed computing. The development also involves a lot of problem statements like scalability, interoperability, upgradability, etc.

So, substrate is an SDK that provide that framework to build a blockchain, so rather than focusing on developing a framework from scratch like the application layer, network layer, RPC, etc, you could focus on developing the business logic or its runtime logic.

#### Substrate has the following advantages

*   It's an open source SDK so you can customize your blockchain according to your needs. Plus they have a very strong builder community to help you with the development
*   The blockchain created using substrate are highly interoperable as it can communicate with other substrate blockchains using Cross Consensus Messaging or XCM
*   Substrate frameworks are upgradable and composable as the state transition logic of the blockchain or the runtime is stored as a WebAssembly object which gives the blockchain nodes the ability to perform ‚Äúforkless‚Äù upgrades

Hope I could help you understand the basics of Substrate and why we should use it.¬†  
  
Let‚Äôs move to the next lesson where we will setup the environment to run the Substrate template node locally üî•
