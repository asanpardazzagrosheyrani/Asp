# Using Yarn, NodeJS and React to Make a Frontend

In this lesson, again, we don‚Äôt need to do anything from scratch as we have a Substrate frontend template (yayyyy).

Let's get to business, shall we?

Download the substrate frontend template from [here](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template).

Or clone the front-end template by running the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template
```

But wait we need to set up NodeJS and Yarn right?

Download and install the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), run following commands to install NodeJS.

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x -o /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
node -v
```

Make sure you install at least v14 for the frontend template to run

Install Yarn using NPM by running the following command.

```
sudo npm install --global yarn
```

Let‚Äôs go to the root directory of the frontend by running the following command.

```
cd substrate-front-end-template
```

Run the following command to install the dependencies needed for the frontend.

```
yarn install
```

Hope we are ready to start out frontend and connect it to our blockchain.

Let‚Äôs run the frontend by using the following command.

```
yarn start
```

If everything went perfectly, you will have this frontend opened in your browser.

Congratulations, you have successfully launched your own blockchain with a frontend. Yep, that's it - that's all. ü•≥

In the upcoming series of courses we will work on these templates and make necessary changes to build our runtime logic.

I hope you enjoyed this course and learnt a lot.
