# Running a Substrate node locally

So we are finally here and I hope you took notes of the things we talked about in the last lesson.

If not I would ask you to go back, take the notes and come back because this is the starting point of blockchain development.

We have a series of courses coming up to help you build full-fledged blockchains like Solana, Ethereum and launch it for the world - so you'll be needing all the knowledge you can have.

Without further ado,

Let’s open the terminal in the root folder of the substrate node template and run the following command which will trigger our blockchain’s CLI and execute the node 👇🏼

    ./target/release/node-template --dev

In this case release is the production version of our blockchain and node-template is the name of the file which helps us to interact with our blockchain, created as a result of the compilation.

\--dev is the CLI flag we are passing to our blockchain. This flag is defined in the CLI config and is associated with a chain spec config so whenever you run --dev, a particular chain setting is loaded into the runtime logic.

You can add more flags as per your requirement. We will learn more about that in upcoming courses.

If everything went well, your output will be like this 👇🏼

And JUST LIKE THAT you've launched a node of your blockchain. This was so fun, right?

Now, what about we make a frontend or a blockchain explorer to see the stats of your blockchain node?

I hear you guyssssss, let’s boot up a frontend then!

**👋🏼 Also, just a reminder do not close the terminal in which you are running your blockchain node or else the blockchain will stop working**

You wouldn't want that. So be super careful!

Onto the next lesson we gooooo
