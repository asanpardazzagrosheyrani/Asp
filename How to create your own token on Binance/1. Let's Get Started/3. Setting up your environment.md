# Setting Up Your Environment

Welcome back! Folks, in the previous lesson you got the overview of this whole course but in this lesson we will setup the environment before getting started with the coding part (next lesson), for that:

1. We will install and set up our Metamask account.
2. We will set up the Binance Smart Chain testnet environment.
3. We will fetch some fake money.

## Creating MetaMask wallet

Your metamask wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a MetaMask account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.

MetaMask has a mobile application and a Chrome browser extension too. I personally use MetaMask on my Chrome browser extension because I do most of the work on my laptop.

Anyways, let’s go!

Here are the installation steps:

- Go to [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io/)
- Click Download and Install the Chrome Extension.
- Setup your secure password.
- The next step is the most important one.
- Secure your 12-word phrase properly, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

Congrats! your account is created and you must have received a public address. The public address will be in the pattern of:

_Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_

You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store Ethereum based tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?

Yes, it is completely safe. You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store Ethereum based crypto.

## Setting up the BSC testnet environment

Complete the following steps:

- Head over to [https://chainlist.org/chain/97](https://chainlist.org/chain/97).
- Click on “Connect Wallet”.
- Click on Next, then Connect, then Approve, and finally Switch Network.
- After connecting your wallet, click on “Add to Metamask”.
- Click on Approve and then Switch network.

You will be successfully connected to BNB Smart Chain testnet network. See in the following gif how I did it where my wallet is already connected:

## What is a testnet?

A testnet is a version of a blockchain network that is used for testing purposes. It is essentially a copy of the main network, but it uses a different set of rules, and it is separate from the main network so that developers can experiment with new features without affecting the main network. Testnets are often used by developers to test new software or to test out new transactions before they are sent to the main network. Because testnets are not connected to the main network, they are not subject to the same rules and regulations, and they can be freely experimented with without any risk to the main network.

## Let’s get some FREE BNB Tokens

We will be using Testnet environment to create our own tokens.

For every transaction on blockchain, we need a native token of that blockchain, since we are building on BNB chain, we will need BNB tokens. So let’s get some fake money.

- Go to [https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart)
- Paste your MetaMask wallet address to receive your free BNB. It should look something like this: _0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_
- Click “Give me BNB”

Now you will have some BNB tokens in your account to pay for the transaction fees, guys we are just 10 mins away from creating our token! Excited, right?

So, we finished setting up everything we need for the deployment, let’s do some coding now! I will help you create your own token contract in just 5 lines!! NO JOKE!
