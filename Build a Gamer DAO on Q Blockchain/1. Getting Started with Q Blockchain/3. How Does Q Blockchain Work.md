# How Does Q Blockchain Work?

Awesome job for learning about Q Blockchain and the history of the blockchain ecosystem. In this lesson, we will look into how the Q Blockchain actually works.

## Pillars of the Q Protocol

Sure, let's use football (soccer) as an example for the Q Protocol:

1. **Constitute (Rules)**: Think of the Q Protocol as the set of rules for a football game. These rules are like the official rulebook that every team agrees to follow. They ensure a fair and consistent game for all players. For example, rules about goals, fouls, and offside help create a level playing field. Similarly, Q also has rules that help create a foundation for everyone on Q to build and work together.
2. **Enforce (Referees)**: In a football match, you have referees who enforce the rules. They watch the game closely and make sure players don't break the rules. In the Q Protocol, there are similar referees called validators and root nodes. Validators ensure that all actions on the field (blockchain) follow the rules, while root nodes help enforce those rules.
3. **Resolve (Disputes)**: Sometimes, players might argue about a decision or a foul. In football, this is where the referee's judgment comes in. In the Q Protocol, if there's a dispute or a problem that the rules can't easily solve, participants can take it to a higher authority, like the International Chamber of Commerce. This authority acts like a fair judge and makes a decision to resolve the dispute. Root nodes then ensure that everyone follows this decision, just like the referee's decision on the field.

**All three pillars** include both on-chain and off-chain blockchain parts. On-chain means the things that happen directly on the Q blockchain, and off-chain means outside Q blockchain. The enforcement is crucial to make sure the rules the rules are respected and followed properly.

## What are the main elements of the Q Protocol?

Lets look at the main components of the Q Protocol, which play an essential part in the Q architecture using the following diagram:

## How does the Q Blockchain work?

Imagine the Q Blockchain as a football game:

1. **Governance framework (Organization)**: Just like a football match has a field, referees, and rules, the Q Blockchain has a strong structure that everyone agrees to. It keeps things organized.
2. **Q Constitution (Rulebook)**: Think of the Q Constitution as the rulebook for the game. It tells everyone what's allowed and how decisions are made. It's like the official playbook of the Q Blockchain.
3. **Validator nodes (Team Players)**: Validator nodes are like special players on the field. They keep track of all the moves (transactions) on the blockchain. To become a validator, you have to stake the highest number of Q Tokens. It's like a competition to become a validator node! And the ones with the most Q Tokens get the position.
    - The distribution of these positions is automatic, continuous, and anonymous. This means that anyone who has enough Q Tokens can become a validator node without needing anyone's permission. It's open for anyone to participate.
4. **Token holders (Fans with Influence)**: Token holders are like fans with special powers. They can support their favorite players (validator nodes) by giving them tokens. In return, they get rewards. Token holders can also suggest new rules or vote on them, just like fans giving input on the game.
5. **Root nodes (Referees)**: Root nodes are like the referees of the game. They make sure the players (validator nodes) are following the rules (Q Constitution) correctly. They keep things fair and secure.
6. **Dispute resolution mechanism (Problem Solvers)**: Imagine if there's a disagreement during the game. Q Blockchain has a system to solve these issues fairly, like having a team of judges. It keeps everything running smoothly without a single boss.

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

In summary, this lesson provided an overview of how the Q Blockchain works, focusing on the three pillars of the Q Protocol: constituting rules, enforcing them through validators and root nodes, and resolving disputes. We also explored the main elements of the Q Protocol. Understanding these components is crucial to comprehend the functioning of the Q Blockchain.

In next lesson, you will dive into what actually DAOs are and understand why you are going to build a DAO on Q Blockchain.
