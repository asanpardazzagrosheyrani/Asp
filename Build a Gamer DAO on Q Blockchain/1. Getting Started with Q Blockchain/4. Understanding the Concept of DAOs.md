# Understanding the Concept of DAOs

Hey folks, Welcome back! In last lesson, you learned about the Q Blockchain in detail. Now, you will learn what exactly a DAO is in detail and how it is important in making decisions in web3. Let’s dive into it right away!

## So, what exactly is a DAO

Whenever someone tells us about any web3 organization in general, one thing they would never forget to tell is decentralization. But have you ever wondered what is it that makes these web3 organizations decentralized? How do they make sure that the decision is not controlled by one single entity as it happens in web2? To understand that, let’s try to understand what are DAOs. 

You would have come across several situations in web2 where decision making depends on the majority. We all would have come across the quote “Majority always wins” at some point in our lives. To give you an example, let us take you back to the time you were in school and had to choose a head boy and a head girl. But before getting there, let’s see what it means by DAO.

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. In simple terms, these would mean web3 organizations that make decision in a decentralized fashion. Meaning, that if any decision has to be made, it should get majority votes to qualify and get approved.

## How’s DAO different from traditional organizations

Getting to our school example, the school would not be deciding who would be a head boy and head girl by its own but will be giving every student a power to vote. Similarly, when a DAO wants a make a decision, the head of that organization cannot make the decision alone. There are set of voters who can vote on whether a particular decision could be taken. You might be thinking who would they be. In our school example, it was very clear that those enrolled in school can vote. In web3, most of the DAOs will have their native token or an NFT. They would then allow holders of these tokens and NFTs to vote.

The major difference though between our school and DAO lies in implementation. Let’s say that the head boy and head girl has been chosen. Now, the school declares the results and gives them official titles. But in case of DAO, the implementation of results happen on-chain meaning our smart contracts should implement these results. Hence, the decision making and execution in DAOs should not involve any human interference to make it truly decentralized.

## That’s a wrap

Decentralized governance via voting is what makes a web3 organization a DAO.  

You can build a DAO on Q Blockchain and enjoy the benefits of transparency, security, and efficiency, while contributing to the vision of a decentralized world and we will see how and more details about this in next section.
