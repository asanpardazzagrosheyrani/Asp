# Introduction to Q Blockchain

In this section, we will see the problems Q blockchain solve that web3 ecosystem is facing currently. So, without further ado, let’s get started! 

## What exactly is Q blockchain?

Technically speaking, Q blockchain is a public, open source and decentralized blockchain. It is an independent blockchain based on EVM. Just like Ethereum blockchain, it allows you to write smart contracts in Solidity, build dApps, and use existing protocols, applications, and tokens.

Q blockchain uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and have a native tokens known as Q tokens.

## What problems does Q solves?

Q blockchain solves several problems that Ethereum blockchain have. Let’s discuss few of them.

1. **Low gas fees:** Q blockchain have low transaction fees that can easily be predicted compared to other blockchains, for example, Ethereum.
2. **Fast transactions:** Q offers fast and reliable transactions, where the transaction get processed in few seconds. 
3. **Enforceable contracts:** Q blockchain allow to have contracts that can force people to do certain task. These kind of contracts are highly useable in businesses where two businesses do a certain kind of contract with each other and enforce each other to follow certain type of conditions and rules.
4. **Governance:** Q blockchain offers great governance framework. This framework makes things predictable. You know exactly how the system works and evolves, which makes it easier to understand and manage.

## Why build a DAO on Q blockchain?

As we discussed above, Q blockchain solves many problems that we might face in other blockchains, which eventually helps build secure and scalable DAO on Q blockchain. As Q supports EVM, this makes it more easier to build a DAO using the language (Solidity) we already know.

> **Don’t worry!** If you don’t understand what exactly DAOs are, we will introduce them in upcoming lessons.

Q offers a great online platform to build a DAO without writing any code, which makes Q so much easy to use.

On top building a DAO, Q offers you to build a secure DAO, where you can add multiple features to your DAO, for example, Merkle tree, Merkle proof, AirDrop, etc. And in this course we will add all these features to our DAO. Don’t get overwhelmed if you are not familiar with these terms. We will dive into them in further sections. 

## That’s a wrap

Q blockchain is growing fast and if you dive into it in early stages you’ll be called a wizard of this blockchain. Now, let’s gets a glimpse of how exactly the Q blockchain works in the next lesson.
