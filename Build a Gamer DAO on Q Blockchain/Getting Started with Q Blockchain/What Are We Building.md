# What Are We Building

gm everyone ☀️, today Metaschool and Q team are very excited to bring the first ever detailed course about Q blockchain for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building? We will be building understanding of Q blockchain and how it works. We will build Gamer DAO with and without using Q GDK. We will add Airdrop functionality as well. This course is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to ace your exciting journey of Q blockchain.

The Q Protocol is made up of proof-of-stake blockchain that's compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Which means, smart contracts that work on other chains like Ethereum also work on Q. It also includes a bunch of smart contracts that make everything run smoothly.

**Why Q?** Q has more than 50 dApps and 100+ partners and builders including Chainlayer, web3.org, Tencent Cloud and many more. It has cross chain connectivity with Ethereum and a bridge too!

## Course overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Q blockchain
2. Create and deploy a Gamer DAO
3. Create and deploy a Gamer DAO using Q GDK
4. Add the Airdrop module as DAO resource
5. Add front-end to Gamer DAO

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for enthusiastic web3 developers who wish to learn about Q blockchain. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), Solidity Programming language, and programming basics because in this course we will focus more on building Gamer DAO.
