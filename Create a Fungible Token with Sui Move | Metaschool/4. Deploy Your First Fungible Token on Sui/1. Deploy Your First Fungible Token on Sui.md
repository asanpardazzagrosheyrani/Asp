# Deploy Your First Fungible Token on Sui

Welcome back! So you have completed writing your fungible token. You did great! In this lesson, you will dive into deploying your token to Sui blockchain. Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Code

Hereâ€™s the complete code of the contract we wrote in the previous lesson, in case you missed it:

```
module metaschool::pepe {
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    // Name matches the module name, but in UPPERCASE
    struct PEPE has drop {}

    // Module initializer is called once on module publish.
    // A treasury cap is sent to the publisher, who then controls minting and burning.
    fun init(witness: PEPE, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 9, b"PE", b"PEPE", b"", option::none(), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }

    public entry fun mint(
        treasury: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        coin::mint_and_transfer(treasury, amount, recipient, ctx)
    }
}
```

## Deploy your contract

Click on the icon on the upper left corner and go to **Deploy**. Then click on Sui Wallet to connect to your wallet. (The Sui wallet can ask you to Connect so click on it to proceed.)

Now select your package from **Deploy package,** in my case it is `metaschool`. Click on icon on the right and approve the transaction when prompted for and then wait until it is successfully published.

After successful deployment, you will see a window like this:

- One tab with your package name has the address of your contract.
- UpgradeCap has the details of your TreasuryCap and package address.
- TheÂ `TreasuryCap`Â is like a manager that controls access to the `mint` and `burn` methods.
- CoinMetadata has the metadata of your coin.

Now click on the 1st icon of your package name and you will be taken to Sui explorer.

Now expand the `mint` function and connect your Sui wallet.

Now go back to the Move studio and copy the first address from TreasuryCap as this is the first parameter of `mint` function.

Now complete the following steps to execute the `mint` function.

- Add the copied TreasuryCap address in `Arg0`.
- Add `100` or any other value as the amount to be minted as second parameter in `Arg1`.
- Add Sui walletâ€™s account address in `Arg2`. You can open the wallet, copy it from there and paste it.
- Click on Execute button.
- Approve the transaction.

You can see the minted token in your wallet ðŸ¥³

## Wrap up

In this lesson, you deployed a fungible token on the Sui blockchain. Now no-one can stop you from writing and deploying contracts on Sui. Good luck with your future deployments!

Next, letâ€™s will wrap up the course.
