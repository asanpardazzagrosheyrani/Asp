# Into the World of Sui

So hey folks, you just understood what is required to start this course. If you are here, it means you have a knack to learn something new. That something new is, you guessed it, the Sui blockchain!

## What the heck is Sui?

So, what even is Sui and why should you know about it?

Sui Blockchain is totally changing the game in decentralized finance, my peeps! You know how blockchain tech is always evolving, right? Well, Sui Blockchain is on a whole new level. It's all about revolutionizing the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and giving users like us the power to rock a secure, transparent, and super efficient financial ecosystem. Sui involves third party audits to ensure highest level of security possible.

Sui keeps things cool with its staking program, using a **proof-of-stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism which is more energy-efficient than proof-of-work mechanisms used by other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here's the deal: if you hold and stake your SUI tokens, you can help secure and validate transactions on the network. It's not like those proof-of-work (PoW) systems that rely on raw computational power. With PoS, it's all about how many tokens you've got and are willing to stake. And guess what? Stakers get rewarded with more SUI tokens for being active and keeping the network stable. It's all about being energy-efficient and making staking a smooth ride for all of us. Way to go, Sui!

## What is Suiâ€™s language?

Alright, listen up fam! When it comes to programming in Sui, they've got their very own language called Move, and it's all about being unique and powerful. Move is designed to tackle the limitations of other popular smart contract languages like Solidity. They said, "Nope, we're doing things our own way!"

Move, being an interpreter, moves at a slow pace compared to the speedy compiled languages. But hey, the absence of a compiler and those pesky compiler bugs actually make Move super-duper secure, way more than Solidity.

Move is all about implementing cool concepts like objects and parallel execution in the most effective way possible. It's like giving developers a superpower to build stuff that's on another level. And you know what? Move is all about that data composability, which means developers can have mad flexibility in playing around with data packages like structs. They're like building blocks that you can rearrange and manipulate to create something awesome!

## What are Sui tokens?

 Sui uses SUI token. Another name used is Mysten Labs coin too. They've got a total supply of a whopping ten billion tokens! Now, let me break down  a few things you can do with those SUI tokens.

- First up, you can stake and get in on that PoS consensus action by helping secure and validate transactions on the network.
- Next, you can use those SUI tokens to pay the gas fees. Yeah, like when you make transactions or do other cool stuff on the blockchain.

## Wrap up

Alright guys, that's a wrap on Sui and Move! You just learned about that Sui utilizes proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and its own unique language called Move. Plus, you found out how you can use SUI tokens for staking and paying gas fees.

In the next lesson, you will set up the environment for writing your own contract. Don't forget to complete the assignment before moving on!
