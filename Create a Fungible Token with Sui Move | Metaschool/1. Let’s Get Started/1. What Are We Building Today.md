# What Are We Building Today

gm everyoneðŸŒˆ, Iâ€™m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Sui blockchain for developers on Metaschool. ðŸŽ‰

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own token in Move programming language and then deploying it on Sui blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of coding in Sui using Move.

Letâ€™s look at how you will be interacting with the token by the end of the course. You will mint your token and view it in your wallet. How exciting!!
