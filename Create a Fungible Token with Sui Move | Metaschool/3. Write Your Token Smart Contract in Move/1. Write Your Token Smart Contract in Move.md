# Write Your Token Smart Contract in Move

Welcome back!  So you completed setting up your Sui wallet. You did awesome! Well, get ready because in this lesson, you're going to learn how to write your token.  Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Online IDE for Move

You need no installations. Just go to [this online Move Studio](https://www.movestudio.dev/build) and let’s start building there.

First create a new package. Name it anything you want. Then select the created package from the left panel. Now you are ready to create your file.

Now it’s time to create a file, just write any name  in module name and the file is ready to edit. For this tutorial we’re going to use `pepe`.

## Write code

Let's go through the code line by line that you will be writing:

First you will add the package name, so make sure to replace `metaschool` with the package name you opted for:

```
module metaschool::pepe {
```

- This line defines a module named `metaschool::pepe`, which will contain the Move token implementation. A module is a way to organize code and group related functionality together.

```
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
```

- Import modules (`std::option`, `sui::coin`, `sui::transfer`, and `sui::tx_context`) that contain pre-built functions and types to be used in the code.

```
    struct PEPE has drop {}
```

- Define a new struct called `PEPE` with `has drop` attribute.

```
    fun init(witness: PEPE, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 9, b"PE", b"PEPE", b"", option::none(), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }

```

- Define a function called `init`, which is the module initializer.
- The `init` function takes the following:
    - Move utilizes a witness design pattern that states that a type passed can only be initiated once. The witness resource needs to be consumed or discarded right away to prevent creating multiple instances of the given object. So we passed `PEPE` struct that has drop functionality.
    - We also passed a mutable reference to `TxContext`.
- Inside the function, call the `coin::create_currency` function to create a new PEPE currency:
    - Pass the `PEPE` witness as the first argument.
    - The desired decimal places as second parameter. For example, for 9 as decimal value and suppose we want to mint 100 token, so we need to pass 100*10^9.
    - The symbol of our token is `PE`.
    - The token name is `PEPE` which is forth argument.
    - Next an empty icon URL is added and an optional metadata too.
- The `coin::create_currency` function returns a tuple containing `treasury` and `metadata` that are `TreasuryCap` and `CoinMetadata` objects respectively.
    - The `TreasuryCap` is like a manager that controls access to the `mint` and `burn` methods.
- Call `transfer::public_freeze_object` to freeze the metadata so that no one can change the coin metadata once its published
- Finally, transfer the `treasury` to the sender of the transaction using `transfer::public_transfer`.

```
    public entry fun mint(
        treasury: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        coin::mint_and_transfer(treasury, amount, recipient, ctx)
    }
}

```

- Define a public entry function called `mint`.
- The `mint` function takes a mutable reference to `coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>`, an `amount` of type `u64`, a `recipient` of type `address`, and a mutable reference to `TxContext` as arguments.
- Inside the function, call the `coin::mint_and_transfer` function to mint new tokens and transfer them to the specified `recipient`.

## Complete code

The complete code for this is below, you can paste it into the file created in Move Studio.

```
module metaschool::pepe {
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    // Name matches the module name, but in UPPERCASE
    struct PEPE has drop {}

    // Module initializer is called once on module publish.
    // A treasury cap is sent to the publisher, who then controls minting and burning.
    fun init(witness: PEPE, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 9, b"PE", b"PEPE", b"", option::none(), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }

    public entry fun mint(
        treasury: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        coin::mint_and_transfer(treasury, amount, recipient, ctx)
    }
}
```

## Wrap up

In this lesson, you completed writing your code for token in Move programming language.

In the next lesson, you will deploy it on the Sui blockchain.
