# Let’s Wrap It Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! 🎉 It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Get ready for a quick recap that will leave you feeling accomplished and ready to conquer the world! 

## Setting up the Development Environment

You set up the development environment and installed all the necessary dependencies. You learned how to:

- Set up the testnet environment
- Connect your Metamask wallet
- Fetch fake ETH
- Set Hardhat project
- Secure private data
- Create an API key for ABIScan
- Set up Chainlink

## Writing smart contracts

You wrote `OnePieceMint.sol` which allows the owner to mint non-fungible tokens representing the five characters of Luffy crew. You used Chainlink's VRF service to generate random numbers and then minted an NFT for the user with the randomly assigned character.

## Compiling the contracts

You wrote the deploy scripts and updated the necessary files to compile the contracts.

## Adding frontend

You added frontend to your dApp, learned to integrate the frontend with the backend (smart contracts), and interacted with it.

## 🎊 Congratulations

You have completed the tutorial and are now equipped with the knowledge to create a dApp.

WAGMI! Peace out! ✌🏻🔮
