# üëë ERC-1155 ‚Äì One Above All

## ERC-1155 and Mainstream Collections

ERC-1155 and games are made for each other. This standard is specifically crafted to cater to the needs of in-game purchases.

ERC1155 is a new way to create semi-fungible tokens. These are new forms of tokens that combine various attributes from previous token standards. Consider it a case of getting the best of both worlds. 

Look at the following example üëáüèº 

You may design a shop voucher - a fungible token ‚Äì that retains its worth until it is redeemed. The coupon has no value when it is redeemed, and it cannot be traded like a typical fungible token. 

As a result, the used coupon becomes unique, containing information about the item redeemed, the client, the price, and so on. As a result, it is no longer fungible. A semi-fungible token standard like ERC1155, on the other hand, may express both properties.

Even though it doesn't garner quite as much attention right now, the ERC-1155 standard has some non-gaming applications. It may be used to tokenize a wide range of digitally represented items, including trophies, charitable donations, incentive programs, discount coupons, and concert tickets.

It has been utilized by  [GDAC](https://www.gdac.com/)  and  [Kriptomat](https://kriptomat.io/)  to both gamify the trading experience and fuel loyalty programs.

Multiple games are using ERC-155 as their go-to standard.  [Enjin](https://enjin.io/),  [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), and  [Horizon Blockchain Games](https://horizon.io/)  have already deployed them there.is a new standard for representing virtual items on the Ethereum blockchain that allows the creation of multiple types of tokens in the same contract. 

Now with the advent of the metaverse, an increasing number of games are employing ERC-1155. Horizon Games (developers of Skyweaver) and Pixowl (developers of The Sandbox) collaborated on the standard, as did the Enjin team, who have helped bring a slew of additional games on board in terms of acceptance.

There are already 30+ Enjin-based ERC-1155s in development that have officially collaborated with Enjin, spanning a number of gaming genres.  [Age of Rust](https://www.ageofrustgame.com/),  [9 Lives Arena](https://www.9livesarena.com/),  [Space Misfits](https://spacemisfits.com/), and  [Lost Relics](https://lostrelics.io/)  are all worth checking out.

Now that we have explored ERC-721, ERC-721A, and ERC-1155, it might be your curious question that which token standard you should prefer to create your smart contracts. Well, there is not a binary answer to it. It completely depends on the use-case that you're trying to achieve. 

You need to critically invest your time and think about the pros and cons of adopting one standard against the others. It is in fact a nice confusion to have in mind as it will allow you to explore the limitations and work towards better implementation plans of your smart contracts as well. So yeah, it is what it is! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
