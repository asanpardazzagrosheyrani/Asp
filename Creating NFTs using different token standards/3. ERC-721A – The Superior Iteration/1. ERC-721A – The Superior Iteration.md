# ERC-721A – The Superior Iteration

After the standard ERC-721, came a superior version to it and brought many improvements with it. This new token standard was called [ERC-721A](https://www.erc721a.org/). Its main objective is to save a significant amount of gas that is wasted in minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction. This standard was built by [Azuki](https://www.azuki.com/) to cut down on the disadvantages of its predecessor and to add on additional much-needed benefits. Therefore, the Azuki contract will allow you to mint numerous NFTs at the same price as a single NFT. Azuki’s partnership with external security consultants ensures that their approach is correct and sound. ERC-721A has been made public in the hope to encourage the community to support and adopt it in order to reduce the carbon footprint and gas costs.

Gas prices rise rapidly on Ethereum following the popularity of NFT projects. Developers need to adapt and grow accordingly. Azuki aims to build a brand for the dev team that optimizes the contract and enables the community to bear the least amount of gas expenses when minting.

Let's get to writing our smart contract.
