# Into the World of Polygon

Before we get started, it's important you familiarize yourself with all that we'll be learning. So, in this lesson I will walk you through the Polygon network and how is it better than Ethereum blockchain.

## What is Polygon Network?

Polygon Network is a Layer-2 chain of Ethereum, built to improve speed, reduce fees and increase productivity. Polygon is a speedy blockchain that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain. It can be used to interact with multiple crypto apps that are exclusive to Ethereum blockchain.

MATIC is a Polygon native token used as fees for any kind of transactions. Whoever owns MATIC get to vote on changes to Polygon network. MATIC can easily be bought and sold at any time.

Let’s look at how Polygon is better than Ethereum in detail.

## What makes Polygon better than Ethereum?

I think you might be having this same question right? So, building on Polygon can reduce the transaction fees by more than 99% thus you can deploy your token at a cost way lower than Ethereum.

Finally, we don’t need to have a lot of money to launch a token but that’s not the best part, Polygon is very fast too so now your users can transact using your token faster and cheaper!

Polygon is a great network for you to build on and create real-world solutions with low fees and freat speed.

That's all you need to know.

Now, let's get our things ready to launch a token, who knows maybe your token will be the next Shiba Inu or Safemoon.
