Deployment 🔨
=============

Deploy your token
-----------------

After we are done with our coding part, let’s proceed to deployment where we will be launching our token on Polygon testnet, just some clicks left before launching your token, 5 more mins to go!

### Deployment and token launch on Polygon Testnet 🚀

👉🏼 Go to Solidity Compiler section on your left sidebar and then click **Compile MyToken.sol**

After the compilation, click on deploy right under Solidity Compiler on the sidebar and select Injected Provider as Environment. 

A popup will appear to connect your MetaMask wallet where you should select the account in which you received your free MATIC from the faucet.

Then, 

*   Click on **Deploy** to launch your token. Do not change any value other than environment
*   A MetaMask popup will appear to sign the transaction. Confirm it and at this point you will have successfully launched your own token on Polygon Network. 🔥

### How to check if your token is created 🔍

Let’s check if our token is deployed correctly. Hold your heartbeat because this is going to be very exciting for the both of us!

*   Scroll down and copy your contract address under deployed contract in Remix by clicking the **COPY icon**

*   Go to [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) and search for your contract address

### Hurray, our token has been created!! 🥹🎉

*   Now let’s add our token to our MetaMask and check if we received our minted 1000000 Mango Tokens
*   Go to your MetaMask, then to Assets and click on **Import Tokens**

That was easy, wasn't it? 😍

**CONGRATULATIONS - YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED A TOKEN of your own & on your own! 🥳🤑**

The code we wrote is basic and is not ready to be deployed on the Mainnet as we are still missing the SafeMath function and we don’t have any utility for the token as of now.
