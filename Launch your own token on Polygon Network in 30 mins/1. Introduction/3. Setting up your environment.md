# Setting up your environment

In the previous lesson you got the overview of this whole course but in this lesson we will setup the environment before getting started with the coding part (next lesson), for that,

1.  First, we will setup Quick node which is a node provider helping us to access the Mumbai testnet
2.  Then, then we will setup the QuickNode with your MetaMask through which we will interact with the Mumbai testnet and also we need MetaMask to pay for the transactions

First, we need to set up QuickNode with Mumbai testnet nodes, it‚Äôs going to take like 5 mins.

## What is QuickNode?

QuickNode is a cloud-based hosting platform that allows users to quickly and easily deploy and manage applications on the cloud.

It offers a reliable and cost-effective solution for hosting high-performance applications with a variety of features such as automatic scaling, high availability, and custom domains.

It provides a secure and reliable infrastructure for developers to quickly deploy and manage their applications.

## Let‚Äôs create a QuickNode endpoint

- First, go to [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner)
- Click on create account or signup with any account you have

- Now select Polygon as Network and Mumbai Testnet as Chain and continue
- We don‚Äôt need any add-ons so click¬†**create endpoint**¬†now

Now to make this process easier for you I have created a short walkthrough on setting up QuickNode account,

If you properly follow through these steps, you‚Äôll successfully created a QuickNode account and completed setting it up!

HTTP Provider link is important for our further process, so make sure you copy this as we need it further in this lesson.

Well done guys, let's move on to set up your QuickNode account with MetaMask.

## Setting up Metamask

But before that, if you don't know what Metamask is and how to setup your Metamask wallet, I would recommend you to go through this course first üëá

‚ö° [Understand and setup MetaMask account](https://metaschool.so/course/understand-and-setup-metamask-account)

If you have your MetaMask wallet ready, skip the step above and let's quickly set it up with QuickNode

- Open your Metamask wallet extension. Go to your Metamask wallet and click on the list of networks.

![](https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/RcDx9aRsZGE2uXjXsVL09Jqj0laLEwiJxWlJDdfl.png)

- A drop-down list will show up with a list of networks but you need to click on **ADD NETWORK** at the bottom of the list
- Scroll down to the bottom and click on add a network manually.

![](https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/xW9IrAeeDziOw30Gv72eI7GjfIFHpbabHcJD7k8l.png)

- You will have a form to fill up to add a new network to your MetaMask account
- Let‚Äôs go back to QuickNode Endpoint Dashboard, and copy the HTTPS Provider. This is going to be our new RPC URL in MetaMask.

![](https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/7PFOR8BtqDN1qDSlwsqHqQlJe9hkX7ldETNhNgdD.png)

Now let‚Äôs go back to the MetaMask add network form, fill the fields as follow:

![](https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/e4StSCenX2xX0EHgeLONiB0QgALh9FKXLSuLYwj9.png)

- ‚ÄúPolygon Mumbai‚Äù in **Network Name (Any name as you like)** and finally
- HTTP Provider from QuickNode in **New RPC URL** field with
- 80001 in **Chain ID**,
- ‚ÄúMATIC‚Äù in **Currency Symbol**,
- [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) in **Block Explorer URL.**
- Click Save

Again to help you will process I have created a short walkthrough for you guys,

So, we have finished setting up MetaMask for our token. Now let‚Äôs get some free MATIC tokens to pay for the transaction fees.

## Let‚Äôs get some FREE MATIC Tokens

We will be using Testnet environment to create our own tokens.

## What is a testnet?

A testnet is a version of a blockchain network that is used for testing purposes. It is essentially a copy of the main network, but it uses a different set of rules, and it is separate from the main network so that developers can experiment with new features without affecting the main network. Testnets are often used by developers to test new software or to test out new transactions before they are sent to the main network. Because testnets are not connected to the main network, they are not subject to the same rules and regulations, and they can be freely experimented with without any risk to the main network.

For every transaction on blockchain, we need a native token of that blockchain, since we are building on Polygon chain, we will need Matic tokens. So let‚Äôs get some fake money.

Go to [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)

Select¬†**Mumbai** as Network,¬†**MATIC** as token then paste your Metamask wallet address to receive your free MATIC. It should look something like this: _0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_

Click ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù

Now you will have some Matic tokens in your account to pay for the transaction fees, guys we are just 10 mins away from creating our token! Excited, right?

So, we finished setting up everything we need for the deployment, let‚Äôs do some coding now! I will help you create your own token contract in just 5 lines!! NO JOKE!
