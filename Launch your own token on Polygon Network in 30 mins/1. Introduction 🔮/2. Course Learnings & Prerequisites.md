Course Learnings & Prerequisites
--------------------------------

Before we get started, it's important you familiarize yourself with all that we'll be learning. 

### This course on how to launch your own token on Polygon will cover 👇🏼

*   How to create an ERC20 token like Shiba Inu, Safemoon, Aave, etc
*   How to use OpenZeppelin library
*   How to use QuickNode to create your dApp
*   How to deploy on Polygon Testnet

But that is not where it ends. In order to launch your token on Polygon Network, you must also be familiar with several tools and have them installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites to build a token on Polygon Network

*   Remix IDE - to write and deploy our code
*   OpenZeppelin - Polygon Network supports EVM so we will use ERC-20 standards
*   MetaMask - to interact with the Polygon Network
*   [Quick Node](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) - to interact with Polygon Testnet (also called Polygon Mumbai)
*   Some MATIC tokens - we can get it from the faucet

Here is a short walkthrough about creating your own [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) account:
