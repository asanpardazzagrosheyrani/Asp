# Challenge: Create a Calculator Contract using Move on Sui

Now that you have covered all the basics of Sui Move, it is about time to challenge yourself and do some coding.

So I’ll explain the what are the requirements of the challenge. And you can build it. So why wait, let’s start!

## Build a calculator

So the task is to build a calculator for integers of u64 using the operators, functions, and all Sui Move basics you have learned so far.

- Create a function and object according to your needs.
- Create a function named `add` that takes two input parameters. It adds the value of two integers and returns the results.
- Create a function named `sub` that takes two input parameters. It subtracts the second integer value from the first one and returns the results.
- Create a function named `mul` that takes two input parameters. It multiples both integers and returns the results.
- Create a function named `div` that takes two input parameters. It divides the first integer with the second integer and returns the results.

## Deploy and interact with the calculator contract

- After completing the code of the calculator, deploy it on the Sui blockchain.
- Now go to Sui Explorer and interact with the contract.

## Wrap it up

In conclusion, this lesson allowed you to practically apply your Sui Move and blockchain knowledge by creating and deploying a calculator (+,-,x,%) contract.

In the next lesson, we will focus on learning the solution to this assignment.
