# Set Up the Development Environment

Welcome back! I hope you enjoyed learning about the Sui and Move programming language. In this lesson, I will guide you through setting up the development environment to run Move on Sui programs on your system. Before we dive into that, it's crucial to ensure that you have installed all the necessary prerequisites on your system. **Don't worry!** I will provide you with the installation instructions for your specific system. So, feel free to scroll through the lesson to find the relevant installation guide.

```
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
```

1. Install `libclang-dev`:

```
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev
```

1. Install `libpq-dev`:

```
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

1. Install `build-essential`:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Prerequisite installments for Windows

Let’s go through the prerequisite installments you need to install Move on Sui on your Windows.

1. Windows 11 already has installed the Microsoft version of `cURL`.
2. Download and install Git CLI using this link: [https://git-scm.com/download/](https://git-scm.com/download/)
3. Download and install `cMake` from here: [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)
4. Download and install [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). Do add them to your Windows `PATH` environment variable.
5. Download and install C++ build tools: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

**Note**: The `sui console` command does not work in PowerShell.

## Install Cargo and Rust

Now that you have done all the prerequisite installations in your system, whether it is MacOS, Linux, or Windows, you need to install Cargo and Rust. Run the following command to do that.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can also visit the [Rust official page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for other ways of installing Rust.

## Set up Move on Sui

Now that everything is done, let’s finally install Sui. Run the following command to install the Sui binaries from `devnet`.

```
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch devnet sui
```

Check your Sui installation version.

```
sui --version
```

**Note:** If you face errors while installing Sui please make sure that all of the prerequisites are updated.

## That’s a wrap

After successfully setting up your development environment, let's move on to running and deploying the “Hello World” program. This will give you a glimpse of how to deploy your smart contract on the Sui blockchain.
