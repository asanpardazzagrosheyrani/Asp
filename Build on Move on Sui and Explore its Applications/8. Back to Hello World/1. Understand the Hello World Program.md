# Understand the Hello World Program

We have run our Hello World program and interacted with [i](http://it.Now)t. As now we are done with the basics, we can dive into understanding the complete code of it.

## Complete code

    /// An object that contains an arbitrary string
    struct HelloWorldObject has key, store {
        id: UID,
        /// A string contained in the object
        text: string::String
    }

    public entry fun mint(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let object = HelloWorldObject {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            text: string::utf8(b"Hello World!")
        };
        transfer::public_transfer(object, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }

}
```

## Explanation

Let’s dive into the line-by-line explanation of the code:

```
// Copyright (c) 2022, Sui Foundation

/// A basic Hello World example for Sui Move, part of the Sui Move intro course:

```

- The code begins with comments indicating its copyright (Sui Foundation) and the SPDX-License-Identifier, which specifies the Apache-2.0 license.

- `module hello_world::hello_world {`:The code defines a module named `hello_world` within the `hello_world` namespace.

```
    use std::string;
    use sui::object::{Self, UID};
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
```

- The code imports various modules using the `use` keyword, including:
    - `std::string`: This is for using the string data type from the standard library.
    - `sui::object::{Self, UID}`: This imports the "Self" and "UID" types from the `sui::object` module.
    - `sui::transfer`: This imports the "transfer" module, for transferring objects.
    - `sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext}`: This imports the "Self" and "TxContext" types from the `sui::tx_context` module, for handling transaction context.

```
    struct HelloWorldObject has key, store {
        id: UID,
        /// A string contained in the object
        text: string::String
    }
```

- Within the module, a struct named `HelloWorldObject` is defined. This struct represents an object with the following properties:
    - `id`: A unique identifier (UID) for the object.
    - `text`: A string containing some arbitrary text.

```
public entry fun mint(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let object = HelloWorldObject {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            text: string::utf8(b"Hello World!")
        };
        transfer::public_transfer(object, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }
```

- A public entry function named `mint` is defined. This function takes a mutable reference to a `TxContext` as an argument.
- Inside the `mint` function:
    - It creates a new `HelloWorldObject` object.
    - The `id` field of the object is initialized using the `object::new` function, generating a new unique identifier.
    - The `text` field of the object is initialized with the text "Hello World!" using `string::utf8(b"Hello World!")`.
    - Finally, it transfers the `HelloWorldObject` to the sender using the `transfer::public_transfer` function. This suggests that the `mint` function is responsible for creating and transferring this object.

You have been doing awesome! I am sure now you can print any text that you want easily. So why don’t you mint your name and try running the code for that? Build and learn!

## Wrap it up

In summary, we analyzed a "Hello World" program in Sui Move, covering module imports, struct creation, and function definitions. Now, you're ready to modify the code and experiment. Remember, practice is the key to learning. Happy coding!
