# Setup Wallet

Greetings! So you have successfully created your wallet, it’s time to import it. Let’s start working on it right away.

## Setup MyAlgo wallet

- Head over to [https://wallet.myalgo.com/new-account](https://wallet.myalgo.com/new-account).
- Accept the terms.
- Enter your password and click on “Continue”.
- Change the network from “MAINNET” to “TESTNET” and click on “Import Phrase”. The reason we need to switch networks is that Testnets are used for development and testing due to zero cost transactions, ensuring code functionality and identifying issues without real value at risk, unlike Mainnet.

- Remember the passphrase that was generated when you ran the command `node CreateAccount.js` in the last lesson. It is the mnemonic phrase, you need to copy that.
